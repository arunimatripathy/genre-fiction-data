The Way of Kings,Brandon Sanderson,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, book one of The Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.", ,9780765326355,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Audiobook|Adult|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy|Magic|Epic|Adventure

Elric of Melniboné,Michael Moorcock,"Elric of Melniboné is a requisite title in the hard fantasy canon, a book no fantasy fan should leave unread. Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which Elric of Melniboné is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melniboné, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre.The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone.

The Iliad,Homer|Robert Fagles|Richmond Lattimore|Prentiss Cummings|G. Cerri|William Lucas Collins|Bernard Knox|W.H.D. Rouse|Alexander Pope|Andrew Lang|Gilbert Wakefield|Walter Leaf|Ernest Myers,"Dating to the ninth century B.C., Homer’s timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”",Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition,9780140275360,Classics|Poetry|Fiction|Fantasy|Mythology|Literature|Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Academic|School|War|Mythology|Greek Mythology

Switch! The Lost Kingdoms of Karibu,Karen  Prince,"Alternate cover edition for ASIN B009H28446. A young adult fantasy adventure about magic, friendship and bravery, but also about bad judgement, rascally witches and thoroughly irresponsible adults.Trouble is brewing in the secret African rift valley of Karibu and Gogo Maya, the witch, and her leopard familiar are about to make matters worse. Of all the dubious magic tricks in her repertoire, they choose a risky ‘switch’ she’s been working on, to escape from somebody lurking in the forest. Unfortunately they overshoot, switching right out of Karibu and drawing an ordinary Zimbabwean boy into the vacuum they left behind them. The whole disaster that followed might have been averted if another boy had not gone and sucked up what was left of the witch’s power, leaving her too weak to switch back again. CPR, the daft boy called it. He should know better than to risk kissing a witch.If you had to choose between Joe’s two best friends, or his fifteen-year-old cousin, Ethan, to lead an adventure into the bush to rescue him, Ethan would be the last one you’d pick because, well … he’s useless that way. Yet, the witch’s leopard inexplicably chooses him, and starts issuing instructions right into his head. Apparently he’s Joe’s best hope because he has absorbed some of the witch’s questionable magic powers. Powers which might come in handy if he ever learns how to wield them, and if he can endure the painful backlash he suffers every time he tries.In a world that quite literally defies belief, where magic seeps into the drinking water for anyone to use or abuse, and the terrain is impossible to navigate without help from extremely risky sources, this is the tale of Ethan’s struggle to reach his cousin, Joe, before Joe falls into the wrong hands and gets himself killed.", , ,Fantasy|Young Adult|Humor|Adventure|Childrens|Middle Grade|Fantasy|Magic|Fantasy|Mythology|Childrens|Cultural|Africa|Fiction

Then he found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic-or did they find him? The three slim volumes woke Kellen to the wide world outside the City's isolating walls. Their Magic was not dead, strangled by rules and regulations. It felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it. Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic-and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side. Kellen's life changes almost faster than he can understand or accept. Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world where the magical beings he has learned about as abstract concepts are flesh and blood creatures-Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom. Especially once he learns about Demons. He'd always thought they were another abstract concept-a stand-in for ultimate evil. But if centaurs and dryads are real, then Demons surely are as well. And the one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage. Turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate? Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And all the world will belong to the Endarkened.

Regrettably, the Earthsea Cycle has not received the fame and sales of Tolkien's trilogy. Fortunately, new Earthsea books have appeared in the 21st century, and they are as powerful, beautiful, and imaginative as the first four novels. The fifth novel and sixth book of the Earthsea Cycle is The Other Wind. The sorcerer Alder has the power of mending, but it may have become the power of destruction: every night he dreams of the wall between the land of the living and the land of the dead, and the wall is being dismantled. If the wall is breached, the dead will invade Earthsea. Ged, once Archmage of Earthsea, sends Alder to King Lebannen. Now Alder and the king must join with a burned woman, a wizard of forbidden lore, and a being who is woman and dragon both, in an impossible quest to save Earthsea. Ursula K.

A Song of Ice and Fire,George R.R. Martin,"For the first time, all five novels in the epic fantasy series that inspired HBO's ""Game of Thrones ""are together in one boxed set. An immersive entertainment experience unlike any other, A Song of Ice and Fire has earned George R. R. Martin--dubbed ""the American Tolkien"" by ""Time"" magazine--international acclaim and millions of loyal readers. Now here is the entire monumental cycle: A GAME OF THRONESA CLASH OF KINGSA STORM OF SWORDSA FEAST OF CROWSA DANCE WITH DRAGONS Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse--unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.  Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister--the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.  Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.""",Re-Packaged Edition,9781780484259,Fantasy|Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adventure|Novels|Fantasy|Dragons|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Science Fiction|Adult|Fantasy|High Fantasy

There, perhaps, lies the greatest irony of all, that I named myself anew after Estri Hadrath diet Estrazi, who in reality I had once been. And perhaps it is not irony at all, but an expression of Khys' humor, an implicit dissertation by him who structured my experiences, my very thoughts, for nearly two years, until his audacity drove him to bring together once more Sereth crill Tyris, past-Slayer, then the outlawed Ebvrasea, then arrar to the dharen himself; Chayin rendi Inekte, cahndor of Nemar, co-cahndor of the Taken Lands, chosen so of Tar-Kesa, and at that time Khys' puppet-vassal; and myself, former Well-Keepress, tiask of Nemar, and lastly becoming the chaldless outlaw who had come to judgment and endured ongoing retribution at the dharen's hands. To test his hesting, his power over owkahen, the time-coming-to-be, did Khys put us together, all three, in his Day-Keeper's city -- and from that moment onward, the Weathers of Life became fixed: siphoned into a singular future; sealed tight as a dead god in his mausoleum, whose every move brought him closer to the sum total, obliteration. So did the dharen Khys bespeak it, himself. . . .", ,9780553112504,Fantasy|Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Fiction

I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.You may have heard of me.So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.",First Edition,9780756404734,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Fantasy|Magic|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Adventure|Adult|Epic

A Kingdom Forgotten,Charles W. McDonald Jr.,"We, the seeds of Humanity, are all the descendants of hardened criminals, fighting to survive the unmaking of A Throne of Souls.Magic and technology have already met on a world far more advanced than our own only to dispense their most dangerous and hardened criminals, for magic has been outlawed. Their descendants—us, here on Earth, along with the rest of Humanity—are now left to grapple with a Creation undone at the hands of an outlaw mage whose Master Plan affects the seeds of Humanity throughout the known Universe. This outlaw—this Dark Knight of Magic—must accumulate immeasurable power to thwart the fork of consequences that brought forth the making of A Throne of Souls. This story, this execution of his Master Plan originating centuries into the past, begins and ends with a triad of pivotal relationships and evolves through his understanding of his own soul. Within the Master Plan, the dichotomy between hate and hope, across a landscape far beyond epic, is illustrated through vibrant characters developed over two-and-a-half decades. IndieReader said, “A Kingdom Forgotten is a textured, subtle and all-encompassing book for serious sci-fi fanatics willing to invest in more than one universe, and in all likelihood, willing to re-read it, too.”​OnlineBookClub.org (female reviewer perspective) said, “The level of complexity is astounding. Frankly, I didn’t feel that I knew what was going on for greater than a third of the novel. By the time I did figure out what was going on, I found a compelling story with a plot so different from any others I have read before, that I remained intrigued until the end. The style of storytelling is so radically different that I am undecided as to whether it is brilliant or insane.”OnlineBookClub.org (male reviewer perspective) said, “A Kingdom Forgotten, the first book in the Throne of Souls series by new author Charles McDonald, Jr., is easily the most uniquely written novel I've read in many moons. There is nothing conventional about this book. Part Wheel of Time, part Warhammer 40000, A Kingdom Forgotten presents itself as a multidimensional epic that juxtaposes ancient kingdom magic with modern world science, and potentially vice versa. On a number of occasions, I found myself comparing its asynchronous narrative to the movie Pulp Fiction, where the protagonist isn't always apparent, the hero isn't necessarily the good guy, and the present doesn't make sense until you've seen the future. To be clear, A Kingdom Forgotten was a wild ride from start to finish, and I am extremely eager to begin the sequel, Black Mirrors of the Soul.”Readers’ Favorite said (about A Kingdom Forgotten), “This is a monumental story with its unique kind of conflict and multiple storylines. Readers are introduced to powerful heroes, magic, portals into other worlds and times, medieval settings, and a lot more. The book is intelligently imagined and masterfully executed, and it is important to note that it isn’t a light read. Yes, the story is complex on multiple levels, including the points of views that shift and that can cause some dizziness in the reader, the writing that is extraordinary, fraught with depths of meaning, and the storyline with numerous characters. Charles McDonald Jr. has created a story that is colossal and that combines various elements of the art of storytelling into one place. I was wowed by the writing and the characters, but most importantly, by the author’s ability to unveil the depth of human emotion and consciousness. A Kingdom Forgotten is a story of great magnitude, one to read with focus, a story that will remind readers of their roots.”A Note from the Author:  This intricate, thought-provoking, epic, and cerebral thriller breaks all the rules crossing over Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Fiction, Magical Realism, and Military-Fiction genres but as you start reading A Throne of Souls, it will become apparent why those rules had to be broken to tell this multi-world story of Humanity and Creation.  I don’t believe in traditional ‘good’ vs ‘evil,’ single protagonist saves the world type of stories. My protagonists are not always ‘good,’ and my antagonists are not always ‘bad.’ I believe in strong, multi-faceted characters that reflect the real-world, with real thoughts, emotions, and agendas. I wanted to bring something entirely different to the market and this is about as different as literary fiction gets. My goal was to be worthy of this inimitable story in the way that I tell it—to bring it to you in my voice, but to do so beautifully, elegantly, and intelligently.  There are several things that make this story unique including:•	A flex-style narrative which illustrates—upon a 360-degree axis—character POV perspective based on their understanding of technology.•	Storylines that reach back centuries, if not millennia. •	Nonlinearity. There was simply no way to tell this far-reaching story in traditional timeline methodologies.The best way to think of A Throne of Souls is like a massive mosaic with individual nuanced clues of information and disinformation that by themselves might appear to be something you recognize though might not make sense, but when assembled with other clues provide shocking answers to questions you may never have considered. For those who read cover-to-cover all of A Throne of Souls, there is a shocking ending coming in a crystallizing moment that will fall upon you like a cascade of dominoes in a complex configuration as each thread collapses inward upon the storylines. I hope you love surprises. Please enjoy it with all my best hopes and wishes. – Charles W. McDonald Jr.", , ,

Magic Casement,Dave Duncan,"MAN OF HIS WORD A princess and a stableboy? It sounds like the worst sort of hackneyed formula romance. Think again, for ""A Man of His Word"" may well be the most original fantasy you ever read. The magic is unique and applied in unexpected ways, some of which the late Lester del Rey admitted he had not met in fifty years as writer and editor. The world itself is unique - there are no humans in Pandemia, only imps, elves, gnomes, jotnar, and many more, all of whom you will recognize as ""human.""In MAGIC CASEMENT the tale begins gently, even slowly, with Inosolan enjoying an idyllic childhood in her father's tiny backwater kingdom, too innocent even to understand that the feelings she shares with her friend Rap are more than friendship. Mystery, menace, and the gods appear in short order, and from then on the story grows in scope and power to straddle the world, and adversity thrusts rapid maturity on Rap and Inos. Populated by unforgettable characters - Aunt Kade, Little Chicken, Doctor Sagorn, and many more - Pandemia is an incredible world of credible people and infinite surprises.", ,9780759243620,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fantasy|Magic|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Romance|Adult|Epic|Audiobook

The cold-blooded conspiracies of the Renne and the Wills--each family desirous of the prize of rule--would sunder the one kingdom, and spawn generations of hatred and discord.Now Toren Renne, leader of his great and troubled house, dreams of peace--a valiant desire that has spawned hostility among his kinsmen, and vicious internal plots against his life. In the opposing domain, Elise Wills's desire for freedom is to be crushed, as an unwanted marriage to an ambitious and sinister lord looms large. As always, these machinations of nobles are affecting the everyday lives of the common folk--and feeding a bonfire of animosity that has now trapped an unsuspecting young Valeman Tam and two fortune-hunting friends from the North in its high, killing flames.But the closer Toren comes to achieving his great goal of uniting two enemy houses, the more treachery flowers. Nobles and mystics alike conspire to keep the realm divided, knowing that only in times of strife can their power grow.And perhaps the source of an unending misery lies before an old king's passing, beyond the scope of history, somewhere lost in a fog of myth and magic roiling about an ancient enchanter named Wyrr--who bequeathed to his children terrible gifts that would poison their lives...and their deaths. It is a cursed past and malevolent sorcery that truly hold the land, its people, and its would-be rulers bound.

First Rider's Call,Kristen Britain,"GHOSTLY RIDERSKarigan G'ladheon had been a Green Rider, one of the king of Sacoridia's elite magical messengers. Being a Green Rider was more perilous than Karigan had ever imagined, for a rogue Eletians had cracked the magical D'Yer Wall which had protected Sacoridia for a thousand years from the evil influence of Blackveil Forest--the arboreal prison of Sacoridia's ancient enemy Mornhaven the Black--and had brought the threat of dark magic into the land. In the messenger service she had been caught up in a world of deadly danger, and though she had defeated the Eletian, she had nonetheless been tainted by his wild magic. Exhausted in body and spirit, and determined to be the mistress of her own destiny, Karigan has returned to her home in Corsa. But Karigan's determination was no match for the Rider's call. Ghostly hoofbeats echoed in the deep regions of her mind, and when she awoke to find herself on horseback halfway to Sacor City--in her nightgown--she finally gave in. Back at court Karigan found the Green Riders weakened and diminished. Rider magic was becoming unreliable, and she herself was having ghostly visions--visions of a strong woman with wild flowing hair and a blue and green tartan draped across her shoulder, pinned with a golden brooch. This woman was no stranger to Karigan nor would she have been to any Green Rider, for she was Lil Ambriodhe, First Rider, and founder of the Green Rider corps. But why was she appearing to Karigan?

The Mabinogion,Unknown|Jeffrey Gantz,"The Mabinogion (Welsh pronunciation: mabɪˈnɔɡjɔn) is a collection of 11 prose stories collated from medieval Welsh manuscripts. The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs and early medieval historical traditions. While some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of the tales is the product of a developed medieval Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written.Lady Charlotte Guest in the mid 19th century was the first to publish English translations of the collection, popularising the name ""Mabinogion"". The stories appear in either or both of two medieval Welsh manuscripts, the White Book of Rhydderch or Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch, written c.1350, and the Red Book of Hergest or Llyfr Coch Hergest, written c.1382 – 1410, tho texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later mss.Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing mss, but disagree over just how much older. The different texts originated at different times. Debate has focused on the dating of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Sir Ifor Williams offered a date prior to 1100, based on linguistic and historical arguments, while later Saunders Lewis set forth a number of arguments for a date between 1170 and 1190; Th Charles-Edwards, in a paper published in 1970, discussed both viewpoints, and while critical of the arguments of both scholars, noted that the language of the stories fits the 11th century. More recently, Patrick Sims-Williams argued for a plausible range of about 1060 to 1200, the current scholarly consensus.", ,9780140443226,Classics|Fantasy|Mythology|Fantasy|Fiction|Historical|Medieval|Mythology|Arthurian|Folklore|Literature|Poetry|Short Stories

Magium: The Mage Tournament (Book 1),Chris Michael Wilson,"Barry is an ordinary guy, with no magical powers whatsoever, who dreamed of becoming a mage for the better part of his life. After dedicating his whole life to studying magic, in the hopes of fulfilling his dream, he finally finds a way to do it.  However, in order to become a mage, he must first win a deadly free-for-all tournament against the most powerful mages in the world.  The fantasy world that the story takes place in is inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and by The Lord of the Rings.

As the series progresses, Barry will meet with other participants, he will make friends and enemies, and he will gradually find out more about the continent he is on, and its inhabitants. He will find out that a person called ""The Creator"" had established several utopias in this place, six hundred years ago, where animals and humans lived in harmony, and food was created through magic. What Barry will get to see through his travels, however, is the downfall of these utopias, some of them being on the brink of destruction. As he begins to get involved with the people of this land, Barry will need to decide if he can simply ignore what is happening before his eyes, or if he will intervene, at the risk of being banned from the tournament, and forfeiting his dream.

Alta,Mercedes Lackey,"DRAGON RIDERVetch had done the unimaginable. He had secretly raised his own baby dragon, a crimson female he named Avatre, and when she first took flight he had been on her back. Although Avatre was new to flight, with the help of his trainer and friend, the dragon Jouster Ari, he had managed to evade pursuit, escaping from the compound that housed the dragon-riding troops of Tia, his homeland's enemies. Aided by the nomadic tribes of the desert, Vetch and Avatre had crossed the vast sands heading north toward the lands still held by Alta.It was Vetch's plan to convey to his half-conquered homeland the secret which he hoped would be the key to Alta's liberation: how to tame dragons. If he imparted this secret to the Altan rulers, would it not give them the edge they needed to throw off their conquerors despite their lesser numbers? And it seemed that his good luck was holding when, after saving a young priestess of noble blood from the dangers of the Great Mother River, he was given entree into the dragon Jouster compound of Alta City.But Vetch, now calling himself by his birth name of Kiron was completely ignorant of the true forces that controlled Alta.

In Alta the Magi, the all- powerful practitioners of sorcery, held the populace--royalty and commoner alike--under the sway of a mysterious weapon. The Magi claimed that the Eye of Light would forever protect their land from Tia--incinerating enemy troops as far away as the seventh canal.

A Quest of Heroes,Morgan Rice,"From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes the debut of a dazzling new fantasy series. A Quest for Heroes revolves around the epic coming of age story of one special boy, a 14 year old from a small village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of the Ring. The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the King’s men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the King’s Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into King’s Court and be taken seriously. But King’s Court is rife with its own family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal. King MacGil must choose an heir from amongst his children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, still sits untouched, waiting for the chosen one to arrive. Thorgrin arrives as an outsider and battles to be accepted, and to join the King’s Legion. Thorgrin comes to learn he has mysterious powers he does not understand, that he has a special gift, and a special destiny. Against all odds he falls in love with the king’s daughter, and as their forbidden relationship blossoms, he discovers he has powerful rivals. As he struggles to make sense of his powers, the king’s sorcerer takes him under his wing and tells him of a mother he never knew, in a land far away, beyond the Canyon, beyond even the land of the Dragons. Before Thorgrin can venture out and become the warrior he yearns to be, he must complete his training. But this may be cut short, as he finds himself propelled into the center of royal plots and counterplots, ones that may threaten his love and bring him down—and the entire kingdom with him. With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A Quest for Heroes is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders.

"Books of Blood: Volumes One to Three (Books of Blood, #1-3)",Clive Barker,"""Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red."" For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the Books of Blood is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:  I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.  These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; ""The Yattering and Jack,"" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; ""In the Hills, the Cities,"" an unusual example of an original horror premise; ""Dread,"" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; ""Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,"" about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. --Fiona Webster", ,9780425165584,Horror|Short Stories|Fiction|Fantasy|Anthologies|Thriller|Anthologies|Collections|Fantasy|Supernatural|Fantasy|Paranormal|Fantasy|Dark Fantasy

There, perhaps, lies the greatest irony of all, that I named myself anew after Estri Hadrath diet Estrazi, who in reality I had once been. And perhaps it is not irony at all, but an expression of Khys' humor, an implicit dissertation by him who structured my experiences, my very thoughts, for nearly two years, until his audacity drove him to bring together once more Sereth crill Tyris, past-Slayer, then the outlawed Ebvrasea, then arrar to the dharen himself; Chayin rendi Inekte, cahndor of Nemar, co-cahndor of the Taken Lands, chosen so of Tar-Kesa, and at that time Khys' puppet-vassal; and myself, former Well-Keepress, tiask of Nemar, and lastly becoming the chaldless outlaw who had come to judgment and endured ongoing retribution at the dharen's hands. To test his hesting, his power over owkahen, the time-coming-to-be, did Khys put us together, all three, in his Day-Keeper's city -- and from that moment onward, the Weathers of Life became fixed: siphoned into a singular future; sealed tight as a dead god in his mausoleum, whose every move brought him closer to the sum total, obliteration.

The cold-blooded conspiracies of the Renne and the Wills--each family desirous of the prize of rule--would sunder the one kingdom, and spawn generations of hatred and discord.Now Toren Renne, leader of his great and troubled house, dreams of peace--a valiant desire that has spawned hostility among his kinsmen, and vicious internal plots against his life. In the opposing domain, Elise Wills's desire for freedom is to be crushed, as an unwanted marriage to an ambitious and sinister lord looms large. As always, these machinations of nobles are affecting the everyday lives of the common folk--and feeding a bonfire of animosity that has now trapped an unsuspecting young Valeman Tam and two fortune-hunting friends from the North in its high, killing flames.But the closer Toren comes to achieving his great goal of uniting two enemy houses, the more treachery flowers. Nobles and mystics alike conspire to keep the realm divided, knowing that only in times of strife can their power grow.And perhaps the source of an unending misery lies before an old king's passing, beyond the scope of history, somewhere lost in a fog of myth and magic roiling about an ancient enchanter named Wyrr--who bequeathed to his children terrible gifts that would poison their lives...and their deaths. It is a cursed past and malevolent sorcery that truly hold the land, its people, and its would-be rulers bound.

The Mabinogion,Unknown|Jeffrey Gantz,"The Mabinogion (Welsh pronunciation: mabɪˈnɔɡjɔn) is a collection of 11 prose stories collated from medieval Welsh manuscripts. The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs and early medieval historical traditions. While some details may hark back to older Iron Age traditions, each of the tales is the product of a developed medieval Welsh narrative tradition, both oral and written.Lady Charlotte Guest in the mid 19th century was the first to publish English translations of the collection, popularising the name ""Mabinogion"". The stories appear in either or both of two medieval Welsh manuscripts, the White Book of Rhydderch or Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch, written c.1350, and the Red Book of Hergest or Llyfr Coch Hergest, written c.1382 – 1410, tho texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later mss.Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing mss, but disagree over just how much older. The different texts originated at different times. Debate has focused on the dating of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Sir Ifor Williams offered a date prior to 1100, based on linguistic and historical arguments, while later Saunders Lewis set forth a number of arguments for a date between 1170 and 1190; Th Charles-Edwards, in a paper published in 1970, discussed both viewpoints, and while critical of the arguments of both scholars, noted that the language of the stories fits the 11th century. More recently, Patrick Sims-Williams argued for a plausible range of about 1060 to 1200, the current scholarly consensus.", ,9780140443226,Classics|Fantasy|Mythology|Fantasy|Fiction|Historical|Medieval|Mythology|Arthurian|Folklore|Literature|Poetry|Short Stories

This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents. It has been my solemn occupation to complete the history of the Baudelaire orphans, and at last I am finished. You likely have some other occupation, so if I were you I would drop this book at once, so the end does not finish you. With all due respect, Lemony Snicket", ,9780064410168,Fiction|Young Adult|Childrens|Childrens|Middle Grade|Fantasy|Mystery|Adventure|Humor|Audiobook|Childrens|Juvenile

On the back of his dragon, Avatre, he had crossed the vast desert and reached Alta, the kingdom of his birth. Once there, he had been accepted into the Jousters compound and had shared his most valuable secret: how to raise and tame dragons.But there was also a dark side to Kiron's life.

The Battle of Evernight,Cecilia Dart-Thornton,"The Barnes Noble ReviewThe Battle of Evernight, the final installment in Australian author Cecilia Dart-Thornton's Bitterbynde trilogy, takes place in Erith, a richly detailed realm filled with a plethora of magical seelie (benevolent) and unseelie (malevolent) creatures. Seamlessly mixing British and Irish myths, fairy tales and folklore, Dart-Thornton (called Australia's answer to J.R.R. Tolkien) creates an extraordinarily wild world, comparable to Middle-earth, that can be both breathtakingly beautiful and, in the blink of an eye, the stuff of nightmares.With her memory slowly returning, the protagonist, Tahquil, along with her friends Caitri and Viviana, vows to find the Bitterbynde Gate, the only remaining passage into the world of Faeran. By finding the elusive gate, Tahquil can stop the impending war between feuding immortal Faeran brothers trapped in Erith: Angavar, the High King of the Fair Realm, and his younger twin brother, Morragan, the Raven Prince. The battle between Angavar and his followers and Morragan and his unseelie legions will likely take hundreds of thousands of lives, but if Tahquil can find the gate in time, all the immortals stranded in Erith will surely end their conflict and return posthaste to the Fair Realm.Fans of folklore and fairy tales should make it a point to read Dart-Thornton's entire Bitterbynde trilogy (The Ill-Made Mute, and The Lady of the Sorrows are the first two books). Her fluid, almost hypnotic writing style is reminiscent of Elizabethan poetry or Celtic music. In short, this is beautifully written, timeless fantasy.

City At The Edge Of Time,Janet E. Morris,"The Sacred Band of Stepsons is a fictional ancient cavalry unit created by Janet Morris and based on the historical Sacred Band of Thebes, an elite strike force of paired lovers and friends that flourished during the fourth century BCE in ancient Greece, where sexuality was a behavior, not an identity. The Sacred Band of Stepsons series of fantasy novels and stories take place in a myth-like milieu that mixes historical places such as Nisibis, Mygdonia and Chaeronea; warriors such as Theagenes (commander of the Theban Sacred Band at Chaeronea); gods such as Enlil, Maat and Harmonia; philosophers such as Heraclitus and Thales; cavalry tactics and customs such as homosexuality in the militaries of ancient Greece with those that exist only in fantasy. The exploits of the Stepsons are chronicled in eleven short stories and eight novels (as of 2010). In a fantasy context, this series explores the difficulties facing war-fighters in personal relationships and the enduring questions surrounding the military's historical mixing of homosexuals and heterosexuals in combat.",Author's Cut, ,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Heroic Fantasy|Fantasy|Dark Fantasy

Beyond Wizardwall,Janet E. Morris,"BEYOND WIZARDWALL the northern adventures of Tempus and his Stepsons come to their apocalyptic conclusion at the Festival of Man, where the games are not the scheduled ones of prowess at swordplay or chariot-racing, but games of assassination and treachery, with the Rankan emperor’s life and the honor of the Sacred Band at stake. When Niko quits the Stepsons, he finds that his troubles are just beginning: not only has Death’s Queen marshaled new forces to entrap him, but Rankan interests desirous of a change in emperors have singled him out as the perfect assassin. Randal, the Stepsons’ pet mage and Niko’s former partner, must unite Tempus, the Stepsons, and hellish aid from magical quarters in a desperate attempt to save the defenseless Niko from Death’s Queen – and himself. In imperial Ranke, Tempus finds himself torn between conflicting oaths and pitted against powers not even his immortal strength can vanquish – powers both mortal and immortal, magical and heavenly, so that, in the end, the god-ridden and accursed soldier must make pacts with his most hated enemies – not only Aškelon, the Lord of Dreams, but Death’s Queen herself – in order to save the souls of those he loves and the empire he’s served so long. And this time, Tempus’ own soul hangs in the balance, as primal forces and even Enlil, the most fearsome storm god of them all, haggle over his fate.", ,9780441057221,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Dark Fantasy|Heroic Fantasy|Sword and Sorcery|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy|Paranormal|Philosophy|Metaphysics|Literary Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Historical Fiction|Historical Fantasy
A Quest of Heroes,Morgan Rice,"From #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes the debut of a dazzling new fantasy series. A Quest for Heroes revolves around the epic coming of age story of one special boy, a 14 year old from a small village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of the Ring. The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the King’s men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the King’s Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into King’s Court and be taken seriously. But King’s Court is rife with its own family dramas, power struggles, ambitions, jealousy, violence and betrayal. King MacGil must choose an heir from amongst his children, and the ancient Dynasty Sword, the source of all their power, still sits untouched, waiting for the chosen one to arrive. Thorgrin arrives as an outsider and battles to be accepted, and to join the King’s Legion. Thorgrin comes to learn he has mysterious powers he does not understand, that he has a special gift, and a special destiny. Against all odds he falls in love with the king’s daughter, and as their forbidden relationship blossoms, he discovers he has powerful rivals. As he struggles to make sense of his powers, the king’s sorcerer takes him under his wing and tells him of a mother he never knew, in a land far away, beyond the Canyon, beyond even the land of the Dragons. Before Thorgrin can venture out and become the warrior he yearns to be, he must complete his training. But this may be cut short, as he finds himself propelled into the center of royal plots and counterplots, ones that may threaten his love and bring him down—and the entire kingdom with him. With its sophisticated world-building and characterization, A Quest for Heroes is an epic tale of friends and lovers, of rivals and suitors, of knights and dragons, of intrigues and political machinations, of coming of age, of broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is a tale of honor and courage, of fate and destiny, of sorcery. It is a fantasy that brings us into a world we will never forget, and which will appeal to all ages and genders. It is 82,000 words.", , ,Fantasy|Young Adult|Fiction|Fantasy|Magic|Adventure|Romance|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Business|Amazon|Young Adult|Young Adult Fantasy

Heroes of MidAria: Heaven's Demons,Felix Cipher,"In the strange and magical world of the Middle Realms, there are many diverse races of people that inhabit the lands. Humans, elves, dwarves, and plenty more civil creatures thrive on this planet. The different races are commonly viewed on a spectrum, and at the very ends of it, there are seraphs and demons. One exalted, and one feared. Every group in the middle of the gradient strives to be like the angels, as they are said to be pure-hearted and loving. Unfortunately, what people know about these beings almost always comes from what they have been taught rather than based on experience. Because of this, it is often preached that a person can only be either good or bad, and anything in between isn't relevant. It wasn't easy for Dacitrynn, who grew up in a very uncomfortable spot his whole life. Being a crossbreed of an angel and a demon isn't something that is welcomed in the world, especially since it is forbidden. After a lonely childhood of growing up as an outcast with the seraphs, it is finally time for Daci's life to change when he is banished from the High Lands following a public fight with his stepbrother that grew violent. However, even though Dacitrynn no longer lives with the angels, society below proves itself to be just as―if not even more cruel―than his birthplace, and hopelessness soon leaves him feeling defeated. Even if things eventually start to calm, there is always another stressor that makes its way into the half-demon's life, and at the end of the day, he can only find himself wandering back to the same two questions that have burdened him since the day of his birth: Is there truly a place for such a horrible monster like him in the world, and what use could his existence possibly serve?", , ,

And once the powder smoke settled, he was left in charge of a demoralized force clinging tenuously to a small fortress at the edge of the desert.To flee from her past, Winter Ihernglass masqueraded as a man and enlisted as a ranker in the Vordanai Colonials, hoping only to avoid notice. But when chance sees her promoted to command, she must win the hearts of her men and lead them into battle against impossible odds.The fates of both these soldiers and all the men they lead depend on the newly arrived Colonel Janus bet Vhalnich, who has been sent by the ailing king to restore order. His military genius seems to know no bounds, and under his command, Marcus and Winter can feel the tide turning. But their allegiance will be tested as they begin to suspect that the enigmatic Janus’s ambitions extend beyond the battlefield and into the realm of the supernatural—a realm with the power to ignite a meteoric rise, reshape the known world, and change the lives of everyone in its path.",US edition,9780451465108,Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fantasy|High Fantasy|War|Military Fiction|Adult|War|Fantasy|Magic|LGBT|Adventure

The Knight and Knave of Swords,Fritz Leiber,"Ramsey Campbell, the highly regarded British horror author, called him: ""the greatest living writer of supernatural horror fiction"". Drawing many of his own themes from Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe, and H.P. Lovecraft, master manipulator Franz Leiber is a worldwide legend within the Fantasy genre, actually coining the term ""Sword and Sorcery"", which would describe the sub-genre he would more than help create.While Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Leiber's fantastic but thoroughly flawed anti-heroes, Fafhrd and Grey Mouser, adventured and stumbled deep within the caves of Inner Earth as well, albeit a different one. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon's grandest and most mystically corrupt city.Lankhmar is Leiber's fully realized, vivid incarnation of urban decay and civilization's corroding effect on the human psyche. Fafhrd and Mouse are not innocents; their world is no land of honor and righteousness. It is a world of human complexities and violent action, of discovery and mystery, of swords and sorcery.""Fritz Leiber's tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are virtually a genre unto themselves. Urbane, idiosyncratic, comic, erotic and human, spiked with believable action of a master fantasist!"" - William Gibson""After too long a wait, the master story teller of us all returns with a huge, anecdotal adventure in the magic-drenched lives of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Glowing imagination melds with gorgeous language to make this one of Leiber's very best... which is a better best than this poor world usually has to offer. Leiber's back: rejoice!"" - Harlan Ellison""It's all Fritz Leiber's fault. If he weren't such a deadly fine fantasist I wouldn't be stopping everything to read his tales. And if he weren't such a master I wouldn't occasionally look out of the window and wish he'd interrupt my routine again, as he doesn't do it often enough. The Knight and Knave of Swords came into my life and took over an otherwise fully programmed afternoon. I stop everything when a new Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story comes into my hands."" - Roger ZelaznyContents:9 · Sea Magic · ss The Dragon, December 1977 29 · The Mer She · nv Heroes & Horrors, Whispers Press, 1978 63 · The Curse of the Smalls and the Stars · na Heroic Visions, ed.

Rumo & Die Wunder im Dunkeln,Walter Moers,"Im fünften Kapitel seiner 13 1/2 Leben nahm Käpt'n Blaubär als Navigator des vagabundierenden Rettungssauriers Mac an einer folgenschweren Aktion teil: Er befreite Dutzende kleiner, herzzerreißend jaulender Wolpertingerwelpen aus einem Haus, das nur Sekundenbruchteile später von einem Bolloghintern zerquetscht werden sollte. Sieben Leben später begegnete er einem dieser Welpen wieder, der inzwischen zu einem ausgewachsenen Raubtier im Dienste des Lügentycoons Volzotan Smeik herangewachsen war. Aus Dankbarkeit befreite der Wolpertinger Blaubär aus den Klauen seines Chefs. Sein Name war Rumo. Zu Beginn des neuen Zamonien-Romans ist Rumo noch ein kleiner, schutzbedürftiger Welpe, der von Fhernhachenzwergen auf einem Bauernhof aufgezogen und verhätschelt wird. Diese Idylle hat jedoch bald ein Ende: Eine Horde bösartiger Teufelszyklopen überfällt das Anwesen und verschleppt alles, was sich bewegt. Und so verbringt Rumo seine intensivste Wachstumsphase in der Speisekammer auf den Teufelsfelsen, einer schwimmenden Insel. Dort halten die Zyklopen ihre lebendige Nahrung, und mit Gier und Begeisterung sehen sie zu, wie Rumo immer größer und appetitlicher wird. Glücklicherweise findet der verängstigte Wolpertinger unter den Gefangenen bald einen Freund: Die Haifischmade Volzotan Smeik -- genau, der spätere Lügentycoon -- nimmt den Welpen unter seine Fittiche. Er erzählt ihm Geschichten und bringt ihm viel Wissenswertes über das Leben in Zamonien bei, bis Rumo zu seiner endgültigen Größe herangewachsen ist und die beiden Fluchtpläne schmieden können. Bald erleben die Teufelszyklopen ihr blaues Wunder! So weit nur das erste der zahlreichen neuen Abenteuer aus der fantastischen Welt Zamoniens. Neben einer ganzen Reihe von Figuren aus den 13 1/2 Leben und Ensel und Krete hat Walter Moers viele neue ungewöhnliche Gestalten ersonnen. Auch Rumo ist eine eigenwillige und eigenständige Hauptfigur, die Moers zu gänzlich neuen Betrachtungen Anlass bietet. Ein Geschenk des Himmels für Zamonien-Fans also, ein dicker Schmöker voll schräger Ideen und abgefahrener Zeichnungen. Ergo: Computer abschalten und den Telefonstecker ziehen -- und den Nachbarn Bescheid sagen, dass lautes, lang anhaltendes Gelächter kein Anzeichen aufkeimenden Wahnsinns ist.

The System of the World,Neal Stephenson,"The System of the World, the third and concluding volume of Neal Stephenson's shelf-bending Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver and The Confusion), brings the epic historical saga to its thrilling - and truly awe-inspiring - conclusion.Set in the early 18th century and featuring a diverse cast of characters that includes alchemists, philosophers, mathematicians, spies, thieves, pirates, and royalty, The System of the World follows Daniel Waterhouse, an unassuming philosopher and confidant to some of the most brilliant minds of the age, as he returns to England to try and repair the rift between geniuses Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device. Having been away from the war-decimated country for two decades, Waterhouse quickly learns that although many things have changed, there is still violent revolution simmering just beneath the surface of seemingly civilized society. With Queen Anne deathly ill and Tories and Whigs jostling for political supremacy, Waterhouse and Newton vow to figure out who is trying to kill certain scientists and decipher the riddle behind the legend of King Solomon's gold, a mythical hoard of precious metal with miraculous properties.Arguably one of the most ambitious -- and most researched -- stories ever written, Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is set in one of the most turbulent and exciting times in human history. Filled with wild adventure, political intrigue, social upheaval, civilization-changing discoveries, cabalistic mysticism, and even a little romance, this massive saga is worth its weight in (Solomon's) gold.

Orb Sceptre Throne,Ian C. Esslemont,"The epic new chapter in the history of Malaz -- the new epic fantasy from Steven Erikson's friend and co-creator of this extraordinary and exciting imagined world. Darujhistan, city of dreams, city of blue flames, is peaceful at last; its citizens free to return to politicking, bickering, trading and, above all, enjoying the good things in life. Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity. While, as ever at the centre of everything, a thief in a red waistcoat and of rotund proportions walks the streets, juggling in one hand custard pastries, and in the other the fate of the city itself. Far to the south, fragments of the titanic Moon's Spawn have crashed into the Rivan Sea creating a series of isles... and a fortune hunter's dream. A Malazan veteran calling himself 'Red' ventures out to try his luck -- and perhaps say goodbye to old friends. But there he finds far more than he'd bargained for as the rush to claim the Spawn's treasures descends into a mad scramble of chaos and bloodshed. For powers from across the world have gathered here, searching for the legendary Throne of Night. The impact of these events are far reaching, it seems. On an unremarkable island off the coast of Genabackis, a people who had turned their backs upon all such strivings now lift their masked faces towards the mainland and recall the ancient prophesy of a return. And what about the ex-Claw of the Malazan Empire who now walks the uttermost edge of creation? His mission -- the success or failure of which the Queen of Dreams saw long ago -- is destined to shape far more than anyone could have ever imagined.", ,9780593064504,Fantasy|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Fiction|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Fantasy|Dark Fantasy|Epic|Science Fiction Fantasy|War|Audiobook|Novels

Only the inevitable fall of the realm lies ahead. As the king has lost his mind, who can then be expected to defend it when a wholly unexpected invasion threatens, and when no one can even remember when Dica last had any need of an army?This story follows those idiosyncratically unique characters who rise to the challenge, who seek a solution amidst the vast and convoluted spread of the castle, and in so doing, uncover much about Dica’s history and about themselves.

In a subtle and enchanting way, it explores much of the mystery of life itself.This is most certainly an epic tale, a tale that ineluctably draws to a thrilling, strange, and totally surprising climax.

Philistine (A Tale of Goliath),Steven Shrewsbury|Joshua H. Leet|Matthew Perry,"The Philistines, a mysterious warrior people known now for mainly one man: Goliath. The giant.  Goliath. A name grander than even the man himself. You've heard of his infamous end at the hands of a shepherd as written in a famous book, but what of the life of the man himself? What book tells his tale?  A warrior among warriors, a son of a god, a living legend. Goliath, the warrior champion of the Philistines. On the battlefield, he runs like a horse, wields killing instruments no normal man may heft, and revels in the fear his presence evokes. Off the field, his will is immutable, his trust invaluable, and his appetites unbearable. Goliath. This man knows no challenge.  But such a reputation will not discourage all men. Scheming rulers and generals, prophetic priests and powerful cults, dauntless warriors looking to make their own legend. Monsters. Gods. For one seemingly unkillable, at the very least, these things can ruin an otherwise pleasant day.  Along with his shield bearer, Abimelech, and soldiers more in awe than they are useful, Goliath will set out on missions for kings, face foul magic users, and walk in the shadows of mysterious halls. History tells us Goliath died at the hands of an Israelite.  Goliath may have something to say about that.   Philistine is the first Tale of Goliath, set in the same world as Steven Shrewsbury's novels such as Overkill and Thrall, and his Blood and Steel: Legends of La Gaul short stories.", , ,

Can they develop their innate powers and magical gifts soon enough to protect themselves and to help the Good of Habitan? Will they be reunited with their parents again? Who can they really trust? How can they save Habitan from the tyranny of Oskana's rule? Finally, how do the events on Habitan affect the Parallel Place, the 'earth' they grew up on?

They face challenges and surprising twists along the way, all while also developing their own innate gifts and magic. As they begin the path to finding their own inner strength, they learn how to face unbearable odds with determination and courage, standing up for what is right despite the possible personal costs. Inspiration for the Habitan Series by Cheryl Skory Suma:The author’s children grew up enthralled with their mother’s bedtime stories. Then came the question, “Mommy, could you write me a longer story?”. The Habitan Series grew out of these imaginative bedtime stories and the author promises continued plot twists, surprises and new mysteries along the way in this four book series. A proud Canadian, Cheryl has a multi-cultural background that includes not only Canadian settlers of various European descent, but also one-quarter Cree Indian/Inuit mix from her maternal grandmother. Her grandmother’s spirit and grace were inspirational to the creation of this story and the use of Cree as the basis for the magical language of Habitan. The scenery and animals behind the story were drawn from the naturally varied and beautiful landscape of Canada.Resources for Teachers, Librarians and Book Clubs:Chapter questions and discussion notes can be found on the Habitan Series website, www.HabitanBooks.com .", ,9780993959103,Fantasy

Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings,Abolqasem Ferdowsi|Azar Nafisi|Dick Davis,"Among the great works of world literature, perhaps one of the least familiar to English readers is the ""Shahnameh: ThePersian Book of Kings,"" the national epic of Persia. This prodigious narrative, composed by the poet Ferdowsi between the years 980 and 1010, tells the story of pre- Islamic Iran, beginning in the mythic time of Creation and continuing forward to the Arab invasion in the seventh century. As a window on the world, ""Shahnameh"" belongs in the company of such literary masterpieces as Dante's ""Divine Comedy,"" the plays of Shakespeare, the epics of Homer- classics whose reach and range bring whole cultures into view. In its pages are unforgettable moments of national triumph and failure, human courage and cruelty, blissful love and bitter grief.In tracing the roots of Iran, ""Shahnameh"" initially draws on the depths of legend and then carries its story into historical times, when ancient Persia was swept into an expanding Islamic empire. Now Dick Davis, the greatest modern translator of Persian poetry, has revisited that poem, turning the finest stories of Ferdowsi's original into an elegant combination of prose and verse. For the first time in English, in the most complete form possible, readers can experience ""Shahnameh"" in the same way that Iranian storytellers have lovingly conveyed it in Persian for the past thousand years.", ,9780670034857,Poetry|Classics|History|Cultural|Iran|Fantasy|Mythology|Literature|Epic|Historical|Medieval|Historical|Religion

Black Mirrors of the Soul,Charles W. McDonald Jr.,"We, the seeds of Humanity, are all the descendants of hardened criminals, fighting to survive the unmaking of A Throne of Souls.Magic and technology have already met on a world far more advanced than our own only to dispense their most dangerous and hardened criminals, for magic has been outlawed. Their descendants—us, here on Earth, along with the rest of Humanity—are now left to grapple with a Creation undone at the hands of an outlaw mage whose Master Plan affects the seeds of Humanity throughout the known Universe. This outlaw—this Dark Knight of Magic—must accumulate immeasurable power to thwart the fork of consequences that brought forth the making of A Throne of Souls. This story, this execution of his Master Plan originating centuries into the past, begins and ends with a triad of pivotal relationships and evolves through his understanding of his own soul. Within the Master Plan, the dichotomy between hate and hope, across a landscape far beyond epic, is illustrated through vibrant characters developed over two-and-a-half decades. While Black Mirrors of the Soul is the second installment in the series A Throne of Souls, it illustrates much of the beginning of the story, especially the back-story of The Cauldron of Hate that forged Damon. This is where you’ll read, see, and feel the fuel for the Fork of Consequences. This is the gut-wrenching, emotional journey that will have you screaming, crying, and cheering for more. From the Monuments of Creation to the Seeds of Humanity to the making of A Throne of Souls, there are plot-lines and clues everywhere in this intricate mosaic for you to unravel.Readers’ Favorite said (about Black Mirrors of the Soul), “Readers are caught up in the great setting, in the kaleidoscopic world-building in this second installment in the series. The setting spans many centuries and moves across multiple geographical locations. The great cast of characters involves heroes and villains that readers will be keen to follow; some of my best characters were Damon and Mira, the powerful witch called Adena and her role in the story, Kaylan, and a host of others. The story begins with action, and the reader is captivated by the evocative prose and the vivid imagery that fill the opening pages. The descriptions will transport readers into other worlds and excite their imaginations in powerful ways. I enjoyed the great dialogues, crafted to read so naturally that the reader feels as though they were part of it. Black Mirrors of the Soul by Charles McDonald Jr. is another great success in a spellbinding and monumental series.”OnlineBookClub.org said (about Black Mirrors of the Soul), “Black Mirrors of the Soul will take you through all the emotions. Just as in A Kingdom Forgotten, good and evil are not the simple concepts you assume they should be. In Black Mirrors of the Soul, the relationship of father to son is explored. The book also includes power struggles, manipulative relationships, pure love, lust, vengeance, and redemption.McDonald’s writing style includes a happy mix of description and narrative. Rarely have I found a book that includes such amazing synergy between foreknowledge and mystery. Information is doled out in a way that compels you to read more and leaves you breathless when you reach the end. McDonald keeps up a thrilling pace while he continues to develop the characters. Consequently, I understood increasingly more of each character while reading the second book in this series. I am glad to give this 4 out of 4 stars. It took me a while to understand what was going on, but this is definitely a worthy series to look into! What a story!!!”A Note from the Author:  This intricate, thought-provoking, epic, and cerebral thriller breaks all the rules crossing over Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Fiction, Magical Realism, and Military-Fiction genres but as you start reading A Throne of Souls, it will become apparent why those rules had to be broken to tell this multi-world story of Humanity and Creation.  I don’t believe in traditional ‘good’ vs ‘evil,’ single protagonist saves the world type of stories. My protagonists are not always ‘good,’ and my antagonists are not always ‘bad.’ I believe in strong, multi-faceted characters that reflect the real-world, with real thoughts, emotions, and agendas. I wanted to bring something entirely different to the market and this is about as different as literary fiction gets. My goal was to be worthy of this inimitable story in the way that I tell it—to bring it to you in my voice, but to do so beautifully, elegantly, and intelligently.  There are several things that make this story unique including:•	A flex-style narrative which illustrates—upon a 360-degree axis—character POV perspective based on their understanding of technology.•	Storylines that reach back centuries, if not millennia. •	Nonlinearity. There was simply no way to tell this far-reaching story in traditional timeline methodologies.The best way to think of A Throne of Souls is like a massive mosaic with individual nuanced clues of information and disinformation that by themselves might appear to be something you recognize though might not make sense, but when assembled with other clues provide shocking answers to questions you may never have considered. For those who read cover-to-cover all of A Throne of Souls, there is a shocking ending coming in a crystallizing moment that will fall upon you like a cascade of dominoes in a complex configuration as each thread collapses inward upon the storylines. I hope you love surprises. Please enjoy it with all my best hopes and wishes. – Charles W. McDonald Jr.", , ,

The blackness above him lingered longer than the rest.Then it shifted.Long midnight hair fell away to reveal the blanched face, mouth agape, eyes glassy pools of shadow. Wrath was still written in her features as she turned to regard Joren, a mere arm’s length away. The stark whiteness continued down a slender neck, where her emaciated skin turned black and sooty.

The Mountain Throne (Sindathi Twilight Trilogy #1),A.M.  Sterling,"The Mountain Throne is the first book of the Sindathi Twilight trilogy, set in the fantasy world of Urrael. Two decades in the making, this world is well-developed and realistic, with histories, languages, calendars, professions, and cultures that bring it to life. The Plot: Aged Emperor Thelden III Arrigar's last days are approaching and the Empire's leaders are taking sides in a struggle for power between rival heirs. Blood runs in the streets and the nights are thick with intrigue. Drake Arrigar, bastard prince and half-blooded sorcerer. Darius of Lorradon, foreign-born Initiate of a holy order of warriors sworn to the Empire. Leasha, senior maiden and chief spy for the Emperor's daughter. These three unlikely friends must navigate the coming storms as plots, violence, and unholy barbarians tear their lives apart. Their trials, failures, and triumphs will have far-reaching consequences, for their people and for their own futures. Characters and Theme: As rich as the world is, the story is ultimately about its characters and their choices. The book follows three protagonists, each with distinct themes. Drake's story is one of self-mastery and discovery, of unlocking the arcane secrets that only one of his kind can understand and struggling to come to terms with an unrealizable birthright.  Darius's is one of internal conflict, investigation, and corruption. As a Champion of Ryack, patron deity of the Empire and defender of the weak, what sacrifices is he willing to make to support and protect his Emperor? What deaths are acceptable? What crimes? And at what cost to his own immortal soul?Leasha's is a tale of treachery: secrets, lies, and espionage. A young woman trapped as a pawn of courtly intrigues, she must use her wits, beauty, and ruthless political mind to extract herself and wreak vengeance upon those who wrong her.  The World of Urrael: It is a world where sorcerers obtain their powers by stealing it from the divine realm and channeling it through their own souls. They pay for this by suffering persecution by priestly powers for their blasphemous theft and by hearing strange disembodied voices in their minds, spoken by demons of the other world through their tainted souls.  The continent upon which the story focuses, Terryth, is dominated by a great empire that arose by conquest, but is now weakened by decadence, mismanagement, and corruption. Barbarians, rebels, and enemy nations test its defenses, waiting for the Imperial dynasty to stumble. Its defenders must decide what crimes they are willing to commit to save it, or abandon it to the chaos of revolution or civil war. The uncertainty in the Empire feeds intrigues as powerbrokers and political rivals fight for the greatest shares of power. Falsehoods, betrayals, and poisonous plots abound and even maidens of the court cannot escape. ", ,9780999202005,Fantasy

The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner’s Ring of the Nibelung,Roger Scruton,"Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung is one of the greatest works of art created in modern times, and has fascinated both critics and devotees for over a century and a half. No recent study has examined the meaning of Wagner's masterpiece with the attention to detail and intellectual power that Roger Scruton brings to it in this inspiring account. The Ring of Truth is an exploration of the drama, music, symbolism and philosophy of the Ring from a writer whose knowledge and understanding of the Western musical tradition are the equal of his capacities as a philosopher.Scruton shows how, through musical connections and brilliant dramatic strokes, Wagner is able to express truths about the human condition which few other creative artists have been able to convey so convincingly. For Wagner, writes Scruton, the task of art is to 'show us freedom in its immediate, contingent, human form, reminding us of what it means to us. Even if we live in a world from which gods and heroes have disappeared we can, by imagining them, dramatize the deep truths of our condition and renew our faith in what we are.'Love, death, sacrifice and the liberation that we win through sacrifice - these are the great themes of the Ring, as they are of this book. Scruton's passionate and moving interpretation allows us to understand more fully than ever how Wagner conveys his ideas about who we are, and why the Ring continues to be such a hypnotically absorbing work.", ,9780241188552,Music|Philosophy|Nonfiction|History|Cultural|Germany|Art|Music|Classical Music|Criticism|Literary Criticism

The Fall of the Phoenix,Daniel  Kelly,"The long siege of Troy, the battles fought over it, and the city's eventual capitulation and incineration are events which have often been retold since their first recitation by Homer. Seldom, however, will they have been narrated with such close attention to the minute particulars of battle, to its reek and terror and pain, as in this startling account by Daniel Kelly. Kelly looks minutely at every detail of archaic combat, as well as at the lives and feelings shaped by it. His Troy is not only a scene of shining glory, but also a grimy struggle for survival and mastery. And he introduces surprising questions: what if not everything in the Trojan war came to pass just as Homer tells us? What if the future of the Roman empire were hidden in the burning ashes of Troy's - and not in the way we might expect?", ,9781788301954,Epic|Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Novels|Mythology|Greek Mythology|Fiction|Suspense|Historical|Retellings|Book Club

The Oracle,K.B. Hoyle,"A year ago Darcy Pennington had no real friends. A year ago she'd thought that magic only existed in fairy tales. A year ago she would have laughed at the idea of other worlds. Then everything changed when she'd visited Cedar Cove Family Camp and stumbled into a magical gateway to a world called Alitheia. It is the summer before freshman year and Darcy and her five friends have come back to Cedar Cove Family Camp and Alitheia. This return is bittersweet because her elusive purpose in the magical realm continues to evade her. Egged on by Tellius, the boy prince she is prophesied to marry, Darcy rebels and impulsively ""petitions"" an entity called the Oracle and requests it give her information as to her purpose. In order to receive her answer she must travel to the Oracle, and so she embarks on a journey along with her friends and Yahto Veli, the nark. Too late she realizes her selfish entreaty has thrown the entire outcome of the prophecy itself into question and endangered everyone. Uncertainties mount between Darcy and her companions as they fight their way through enemy territory to locate the Oracle, and an unwelcome visitor from Cedar Cove adds a layer of mystery that none of them are prepared for. But the perils of the quest are nothing when compared to what lies in wait for her in the lair of the Oracle.

The Forgotten Tale,J.M. Frey,"Forsyth Turn has finally become a hero—however reluctantly. But now that Lucy Piper has married him and they’ve started a family in her world, his adventuring days are behind him. Yet not all is as it should be. Beloved novels are disappearing at an alarming rate, not just from the minds of readers like Pip, but from bookshelves as well. Almost as if they had never been. Almost like magic.Forsyth fears that it is his fault—that Pip’s childhood tales are vanishing because he, a book character, has escaped his pages. But when he and Pip are sucked back into The Tales of Kintyre Turn against their will, they realize that something much more deadly and dire is happening. The stories are vanishing from Forsyth’s world too. So Forsyth sets out on a desperate journey across Hain to discover how, and why, the stories are disappearing… before their own world vanishes forever.In this clever follow-up to The Untold Tale, The Forgotten Tale questions what it means to create a legacy, and what we owe to those who come after us. ----Praise for The Accidental Turn series.If I could mark this as 10/5 stars, I would, but that's impossible, so 5/5 it is, with much hearts and swoons. The Untold Tale is delicious, each word meant to be savoured, breathed in, nibbled at, full of hidden delight and wonder. -- Ana Tan, A Tsp blogThis story is nothing short of fun, unexpected, and a little bit queer. If your interested in a Science Fiction/Fantasy undertaking with all of the ingredients of a queer anthology, The Untold Tale is for you. - Dallas Barnes, PInk Play Magazine“I started reading Untold Tale, and was captivated. This superb novel grabbed me from the opening sentence, and never let go. The very best fantasy stories show us fresh new settings in which deeds and events matter—but first and foremost, they give us colorful, captivating characters we fall in love with, or love to hate, or are fascinated by.	Untold Tale does all of this, and more. We see someone from a world we know plunged into a world that is strange to us, through the eyes of that unfamiliar world. And we care what happens to her, and to everyone we meet in Untold Tale’s pages.	And the whole tale is several clever twists on the oh-so-familiar fantasies we’ve read before.	I want more. Books more” —Ed Greenwood, Forgotten RealmsI think that J.M. Frey's The Untold Tale is the most important work of fantasy written in 2015. It may be the most important work of fantasy written this decade, but I'll have to get back to you on that in 2020. -- Mike Perschon, PhD", , ,Fantasy

Original.==You know how all those old fairy tales take you through lots of scary adventures till you finally reach that inevitable line: ""And they lived happily ever after..."" Guess what?

Phantastes,George MacDonald|Lin Carter,"C.S. Lewis said that upon reading this astonishing 19th-century fairy tale he ""had crossed a great frontier,"" and numerous others both before and since have felt similarly.In MacDonald's fairy tales, both those for children and (like this one) those for adults, the ""fairy land"" clearly represents the spiritual world, or our own world revealed in all of its depth and meaning. At times almost forthrightly allegorical, at other times richly dreamlike (and indeed having a close connection to the symbolic world of dreams), this story of a young man who finds himself on a long journey through a land of fantasy is more truly the story of the spiritual quest that is at the core of his life's work, a quest that must end with the ultimate surrender of the self.The glory of MacDonald's work is that this surrender is both hard won (or lost!) and yet rippling with joy when at last experienced. As the narrator says of a heavenly woman in this tale, ""She knew something too good to be told."" One senses the same of the author himself.Newly designed and typeset in a modern 6-by-9-inch format by Waking Lion Press.", ,9781600964015,Fantasy|Fiction|Classics|Christian|Literature|Fantasy|Fairy Tales|Christian Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Literature|19th Century|Novels

Cleopatra: A Life,Stacy Schiff,"The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer brings to life the most intriguing woman in the history of the world: Cleopatra, the last queen of Egypt.Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnets, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator.Though her life spanned fewer than forty years, it reshaped the contours of the ancient world. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and–after his murder–three more with his protégé. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of the age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imaginations ever since.Famous long before she was notorious, Cleopatra has gone down in history for all the wrong reasons. Shakespeare and Shaw put words in her mouth. Michelangelo, Tiepolo, and Elizabeth Taylor put a face to her name. Along the way, Cleopatra’s supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a masterly return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff here boldly separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order. Rich in detail, epic in scope, Schiff ‘s is a luminous, deeply original reconstruction of a dazzling life.", ,9780316001922,History|Biography|Nonfiction|Historical|Northern Africa|Egypt|Biography Memoir|Audiobook|Cultural|Africa|History|Ancient History|Womens

"The Mahabharata: A Modern Rendering, Vol. 1",Ramesh Menon,"The Mahabharata is the more recent of India's two great epics, and by far the longer. First composed by the Maharishi Vyasa in verse, it has come down the centuries in the timeless oral tradition of guru and sishya, profoundly influencing the history, culture, and art of not only the Indian subcontinent but most of south-east Asia. At 100,000 couplets, it is seven times as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey combined: far and away the greatest recorded epic known to man.The Mahabharata is the very Book of Life: in its variety, majesty and, also, in its violence and tragedy. It has been said that nothing exists that cannot be found within the pages of this awesome legend. The epic describes a great war of some 5000 years ago, and the events that led to it. The war on Kurukshetra sees ten million warriors slain, brings the dwapara yuga to an end, and ushers in a new and sinister age: this present kali yuga, modern times.At the heart of the Mahabharata nestles the Bhagavad Gita, the Song of God. Senayor ubhayor madhye, between two teeming armies, Krishna expounds the eternal dharma to his warrior of light, Arjuna. At one level, all the restless action of the Mahabharata is a quest for the Gita and its sacred stillness. After the carnage, it is the Gita that survives, immortal lotus floating upon the dark waters of desolation: the final secret!With its magnificent cast of characters, human, demonic, and divine, and its riveting narrative, the Mahabharata continues to enchant readers and scholars the world over. This new rendering brings the epic to the contemporary reader in sparkling modern prose. It brings alive all the excitement, magic, and grandeur of the original - for our times.", ,9780595401871,Fantasy|Mythology|Cultural|India|Classics|Fantasy|Religion|Religion|Hinduism|Philosophy|Spirituality|Epic|Asian Literature|Indian Literature

Where the Garden Begins,J. Suthern Hicks,"""I found this book to be wonderfully written and reminiscent of C S Lewis. I actually was surprised and delighted at the scientific explanations throughout this fictional book that again took me back to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. This was more of a modern day approach to that styling and this author has created a beautiful and entertaining fantasy world that is nice to get lost in.""""Great read, I highly recommend it! A beautiful and well thought out blend of Creation truths and science. This is a great book for all ages (read it with my wife), especially teenagers who are seeking the truth. Engaging and fun, the characters and their challenges in faith speak fully for our need to trust the one true GOD and Christ's finished work on the cross.""In order to survive this otherworldly experience, Seth and Melissa must work together for the first time in their lives.

The Secret Knowledge of Water,Craig Childs,"The ""essence of the American desert,"" as the subtitle of Craig Childs's book has it, is water. A desert, by definition, lacks it, but when water does come, it comes in torrential, sometimes devastating abundance. Childs, a thirtysomething desert rat with a vast knowledge of the Southwest's remote corners, knows this fact well. ""Most rain falling anywhere but the desert comes slow enough that it is swallowed by the soil without comment,"" he observes. ""Desert rains, powerful and sporadic, tend to hit the ground, gather into floods, and are gone before the water can sink five inches into the ground.""The travels that Childs recounts in this vivid narrative take him from places sometimes parched, sometimes swimming, from the depths of the Grand Canyon to the dry limestone tanks of the lava-strewn Sonoran Desert. As he travels, Childs gives a close reading of the desert landscape (""the moral,"" he writes at one point, ""is that if you know the land and its maps, you might live""), observing the rocks, plants, animals, and people that call it home. Some of his adventures will remind readers of Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire—save that Childs writes without Abbey's bluster, and with a measured lyricism that well suits the achingly lovely back canyons and cactus forests of the Southwest. By turns travelogue, ecological treatise, and meditative essay, Childs's book will speak to anyone who has spent time under desert skies, wondering when the next drop of rain might fall.", ,9780316610698,Nonfiction|Environment|Nature|Science|Environment|Adventure|Travel|Science|Natural History|Nature|Outdoors|History|Autobiography|Memoir

My heart, after all, was already broken.And that’s why I’m here, I thought wryly, glancing up from the all- too-familiar patient room floor at Apollo City Hospital.Between the tarnished sense of sterility, its ash-colored tiles, and the dulled-white walls, I almost felt at home. In the last six years, I’d come here at least once every couple of months. Between all my visits, I had counted the cabinets along the wall countless times, even if I always forgot how many there actually were in the end.That wasn’t the only thing I’d forgotten, either. I frowned at the sudden, overwhelming scent of iodine.How long have I been sitting here, to have forgotten that?I hated that smell. It wasn’t just unpleasant in itself; it also brought up a wide array of unpleasant memories.“What is it, Raiya?”Despite my discomfort, a small, reassuring smile was already on my lips as I looked over at my grandfather. Through the loose tresses of my coppery hair, I saw him watching me with a concerned look on his face.My grandpa was a thin man, with a bushy, white beard and kind, ageless eyes. Every day since I’d finished elementary school, it seemed as though he was getting shorter as I was getting taller. As I gazed at him, taking in his plain clothes and his oversized coat, I thought how easy it would be for the average person to dismiss him, to see him as harmless and old, barely indistinguishable from any man walking in the street.Grandpa would never be that to me. No—to me, he was my hero.FROM THE AUTHOR: Welcome to the Starlight Chronicles, an epic fantasy adventure about fallen stars!

Flight from Nevèrÿon,Samuel R. Delany,"In his four-volume series Return to Nevèrÿon, Hugo and Nebula award-winner Samuel R.

The eleven stories, novellas, and novels in Return to Nevèrÿon's four volumes chronicle a long-ago land on civilization's brink, perhaps in Asia or Africa, or even on the Mediterranean.

"The Mahabharata: A Modern Rendering, Vol. 2",Ramesh Menon,"The Mahabharata is the more recent of India's two great epics, and by far the longer. First composed by the Maharishi Vyasa in verse, it has come down the centuries in the timeless oral tradition of guru and sishya, profoundly influencing the history, culture, and art of not only the Indian subcontinent but most of south-east Asia. At 100,000 couplets, it is seven times as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey combined: far and away the greatest recorded epic known to man. The Mahabharata is the very Book of Life: in its variety, majesty and, also, in its violence and tragedy. It has been said that nothing exists that cannot be found within the pages of this awesome legend. The epic describes a great war of some 5000 years ago, and the events that led to it. The war on Kurukshetra sees ten million warriors slain, brings the dwapara yuga to an end, and ushers in a new and sinister age: this present kali yuga, modern times. At the heart of the Mahabharata nestles the Bhagavad Gita, the Song of God. Senayor ubhayor madhye, between two teeming armies, Krishna expounds the eternal dharma to his warrior of light, Arjuna. At one level, all the restless action of the Mahabharata is a quest for the Gita and its sacred stillness. After the carnage, it is the Gita that survives, immortal lotus floating upon the dark waters of desolation: the final secret! With its magnificent cast of characters, human, demonic, and divine, and its riveting narrative, the Mahabharata continues to enchant readers and scholars the world over. This new rendering brings the epic to the contemporary reader in sparkling modern prose. It brings alive all the excitement, magic, and grandeur of the original - for our times.", ,9780595401888,Fantasy|Mythology|Religion|Religion|Hinduism|Epic|Cultural|India|Fantasy|Asian Literature|Indian Literature|Philosophy|Spirituality|Fiction

No Logo,Naomi Klein,"With a new Afterword to the 2002 edition, No Logo employs journalistic savvy and personal testament to detail the insidious practices and far-reaching effects of corporate marketing—and the powerful potential of a growing activist sect that will surely alter the course of the 21st century. First published before the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, this is an infuriating, inspiring, and altogether pioneering work of cultural criticism that investigates money, marketing, and the anti-corporate movement.As global corporations compete for the hearts and wallets of consumers who not only buy their products but willingly advertise them from head to toe—witness today's schoolbooks, superstores, sporting arenas, and brand-name synergy—a new generation has begun to battle consumerism with its own best weapons. In this provocative, well-written study, a front-line report on that battle, we learn how the Nike swoosh has changed from an athletic status-symbol to a metaphor for sweatshop labor, how teenaged McDonald's workers are risking their jobs to join the Teamsters, and how ""culture jammers"" utilize spray paint, computer-hacking acumen, and anti-propagandist wordplay to undercut the slogans and meanings of billboard ads (as in ""Joe Chemo"" for ""Joe Camel"").No Logo will challenge and enlighten students of sociology, economics, popular culture, international affairs, and marketing.""This book is not another account of the power of the select group of corporate Goliaths that have gathered to form our de facto global government. Rather, it is an attempt to analyze and document the forces opposing corporate rule, and to lay out the particular set of cultural and economic conditions that made the emergence of that opposition inevitable."" —Naomi Klein, from her Introduction", ,9780312421434,Nonfiction|Politics|Economics|Business|Sociology|History|Culture|Society|Cultural|Design|Philosophy

Academic Exercises,K.J. Parker,"Academic Exercises is the first collection of shorter work by master novelist K.J. Parker, and it is a stunner. Weighing in at over 500 pages, this generous volume gathers together thirteen highly distinctive stories, essays, and novellas, including the recent World Fantasy Award-Winner, “Let Maps to Others”. The result is a significant publishing event, a book that belongs on the shelf of every serious reader of imaginative fiction.The collection opens with the World Fantasy Award-winning “A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong”, a story of music and murder set against a complex mentor/pupil relationship, and closes with the superb novella “Blue & Gold”, which features what may be the most beguiling opening lines in recent memory. In between, Parker has assembled a treasure house of narrative pleasures. In “A Rich, Full Week”, an itinerant “wizard” undergoes a transformative encounter with a member of the “restless dead.” “Purple & Black”, the longest story in the book, is an epistolary tale about a man who inherits the most hazardous position imaginable: Emperor. “Amor Vincit Omnia” recounts a confrontation with a mass murderer who may have mastered an impossible form of magic.Rounding out the volume — and enriching it enormously — are three fascinating and illuminating essays that bear direct relevance to Parker’s unique brand of fiction: “On Sieges”, “Cutting Edge Technology”, and “Rich Men’s Skins”.Taken singly, each of these thirteen pieces is a lovingly crafted gem. Together, they constitute a major and enduring achievement.

The epic is called the Adi Kavya, the world's first poem. The God Brahma himself is meant to have inspired Valmiki to create his classic, in twenty-four thousand slokas.The sages of India have always said that the true purpose of the Ramayana is to awaken its reader spiritually, and to send him forth on the great journey that leads to Moksha, to God.Though he takes no liberties with the story, Ramesh Menon's Ramayana is a novelist's lush, imaginative rendering of the epic, rather than a scholar's translation .

Home,Uvi Poznansky|Zeev Kachel,"A simple word; a loaded one. You can say it in a whisper; you can say it in a cry. Expressed in the voices of father and daughter, you can hear a visceral longing for an ideal place, a place never to be found again. Imagine the shock, imagine the sadness when a daughter discovers her father’s work, the poetry he had never shared with anyone during the last two decades of his life. Six years after that moment of discovery, which happened in her childhood home while mourning for his passing, Uvi Poznansky presents a tender tribute: a collection of poems and prose, half of which is written by her, and half—by her father, the author, poet and artist Zeev Kachel. She has been translating his poems for nearly a year, with careful attention to rhyme and rhythm, in an effort to remain faithful to the spirit of his words. Zeev’s writing is always autobiographical in nature; you can view it as an ongoing diary of his life. Uvi’s writing is rarely so, especially when it comes to her prose. She is a storyteller who delights in conjuring up various figments of her imagination, and fleshing them out on paper. She sees herself chasing her characters with a pen, in an attempt to see the world from their point of view, and to capture their voices. But in some of her poems, she offers you a rare glimpse into her most guarded, intensely private moments, yearning for Home.", ,9780984993239,Poetry

EDEN FOUND,Dustin Lawson,"The Garden of Eden, a peaceful world formed from Creation, and Valdar, a harsh survival of the fittest world formed from evolution, have existed side by side with only a river separating them for earth’s entire 72 year existence. The two worlds have had no interaction because domed over Eden is Innocence Guard, an invisible protective energy field that keeps anything from leaving or entering the garden as long as Eden is innocent. A half angel and half demon entity named Demjel sits in the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil waiting to carry out his mission, which is to convince the first human sinner that their decision to eat forbidden fruit was a good choice. But in Eden’s 72 years neither Adam, Eve, nor any of their three hundred descendants have eaten forbidden fruit. The story opens with Demjel performing his favorite hobby, restlessly mocking sinless Eden for how ignorant and boring it is. Then Eden’s newest couple, Ariel and Lena, consummates their relationship under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, a practice that has always been done under the Tree of Life. That night, alone, one of them comes back to the tree and eats forbidden fruit, eliminating Eden’s sinlessness and destroying the protection of Innocence Guard. Meanwhile, the most physically and mentally evolved creature in Valdar, a four armed flying self-aware beast named Sife, has been trying to find a way into Eden because he thinks the garden contains a higher level of evolution than what Valdar can provide for him. With Innocence Guard decimated he finally has his wish.Will Valdar destroy Eden or will Adam find a way to restore Eden’s sinlessness, thus restoring Innocence Guard to full strength?

When on-the-job training entails battling demons, learning magic through trial and error, and living in a world without toilet paper, things could get rough. But to be dropped in the middle of a forest and having to do it on your own with no instruction…welcome to James’ world.It all gets started when his grandfather suggests to James, a young man on the verge of graduating high school, that he check out the following advertisement for a job. “Magic! Real Magic! Ever wanted to learn? We require someone with intelligence and a disciplined mind. Those well versed in fantasy novels and role playing games a plus. May need to travel.”Sounded like the perfect job for a veteran role-player and avid fantasy reader. James had no idea he’d be whisked to another world, completely cut off from friends and family. Arriving in a meadow in the middle of a forest, he’s greeted by a creature not entirely human. He was then told three things:Magic works here…Don’t try to go home…Get to the village of Trendle…Then the creature vanished.Which way was Trendle? Where was he? What might inhabit the forest that will seek his ruination? These were but a few of the questions needing to be unraveled. Alone with only his wits and knowledge gleaned from hundreds of books and dungeon campaigns, he started out just trying to survive. He soon learned that one mistake, one lapse in judgment could mean his death. Not long after arriving, he made the acquaintance of Miko, a street-wise kid who quickly became his friend and companion. Little did he know that the strength within this child from the streets of Bearn, a strength that would be tested again and again as they waded through battle after battle, delved in hidden passages deep beneath the earth, and faced off against an the might of an Empire, would be invaluable in the trials ahead.The Unsuspecting Mage is the first book of The Morcyth Saga, a seven book epic fantasy adventure. It follows James as he seeks first to master the art of magic then to uncover the reason why he had been brought to this strange new world where armies are on the move and gods meddle in the affairs of men.

The Last Werewolf,Glen Duncan,"Here is a powerful, definitive new version of the werewolf legend—mesmerising and incredibly sexy. In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century—a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human.Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but otherwise in the pink of health. The nonstop sex and exercise he's still getting probably contribute to that, as does his diet: unusual amounts of flesh and blood (at least some from friends and relatives). Jake, of course, is a werewolf, and with the death of his colleague he has now become the only one of his kind. This depresses Jake to the point that he's been contemplating suicide. Yet there are powerful forces who for very different reasons want - and have the power - to keep Jake alive. Here is a powerful new version of the werewolf legend - mesmerizing and undeniably sexy, and with moments of violence so elegantly wrought they dazzle rather than repel. But perhaps its most remarkable achievement is to make the reader feel sympathy for a man who can only be described as a monster - and in doing so, remind us what it means to be human. One of the most original, audacious, and terrifying novels in years.", ,9781847679444,Fantasy|Horror|Fiction|Shapeshifters|Werewolves|Fantasy|Paranormal|Fantasy|Urban Fantasy|Fantasy|Supernatural|Adult|Audiobook|Paranormal|Vampires

In An Echo in the Bone, the seventh volume, Gabaldon continues the extraordinary story of the eighteenth-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his twentieth-century time-traveling wife, Claire Randall.Jamie Fraser, former Jacobite and reluctant rebel, is already certain of three things about the American rebellion: The Americans will win, fighting on the side of victory is no guarantee of survival, and he’d rather die than have to face his illegitimate son—a young lieutenant in the British army—across the barrel of a gun.Claire Randall knows that the Americans will win, too, but not what the ultimate price may be. That price won’t include Jamie’s life or his happiness, though—not if she has anything to say about it.Meanwhile, in the relative safety of the twentieth century, Jamie and Claire’s daughter, Brianna, and her husband, Roger MacKenzie, have resettled in a historic Scottish home where, across a chasm of two centuries, the unfolding drama of Brianna’s parents’ story comes to life through Claire’s letters. The fragile pages reveal Claire’s love for battle-scarred Jamie Fraser and their flight from North Carolina to the high seas, where they encounter privateers and ocean battles—as Brianna and Roger search for clues not only to Claire’s fate but to their own. Because the future of the MacKenzie family in the Highlands is mysteriously, irrevocably, and intimately entwined with life and death in war-torn colonial America.With stunning cameos of historical characters from Benedict Arnold to Benjamin Franklin, An Echo in the Bone is a soaring masterpiece of imagination, insight, character, and adventure—a novel that echoes in the mind long after the last page is turned.BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from Diana Gabaldon's Written in My Own Heart's Blood.", ,9780752898476,Historical|Historical Fiction|Romance|Fiction|Fantasy|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Historical|Romance|Historical Romance|Audiobook|Adult|Cultural|Scotland

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS INCLUDED Story Behind the Book“When my six kids’ eyes glossed over during a reading from the Bible, I paused to explain the significance of redemption to a sin-sick soul. I was rewarded with patronizing elephant nods and more blank stares. Shortly thereafter, I awoke in the middle of the night with a medieval story enveloping my mind. I wrote it down and later read it to my children. Their waning attention transformed into complete anticipation. I was amazed and disappointed. Why did it take a fictional story, not a Bible passage, to get that response? Then I realized—that is how Jesus taught! Parables are powerful! I penned the Kingdom series to help young people get excited about the supremely significant story of Jesus Christ and His mission to save mankind.” —Chuck Black", ,9781590526804,Fantasy|Christian|Christian Fiction|Fiction|Young Adult|Historical|Medieval|Christian Fiction|Christian Fantasy|Childrens|Middle Grade|Adventure|Childrens

Written in My Own Heart's Blood,Diana Gabaldon,"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BOOKLISTIn her now classic novel Outlander, Diana Gabaldon told the story of Claire Randall, an English ex-combat nurse who walks through a stone circle in the Scottish Highlands in 1946, and disappears . . . into 1743. The story unfolded from there in seven bestselling novels, and CNN has called it “a grand adventure written on a canvas that probes the heart, weighs the soul and measures the human spirit across [centuries].” Now the story continues in Written in My Own Heart’s Blood. 1778: France declares war on Great Britain, the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George Washington’s troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit. At this moment, Jamie Fraser returns from a presumed watery grave to discover that his best friend has married his wife, his illegitimate son has discovered (to his horror) who his father really is, and his beloved nephew, Ian, wants to marry a Quaker. Meanwhile, Jamie’s wife, Claire, and his sister, Jenny, are busy picking up the pieces. The Frasers can only be thankful that their daughter Brianna and her family are safe in twentieth-century Scotland. Or not. In fact, Brianna is searching for her own son, who was kidnapped by a man determined to learn her family’s secrets. Her husband, Roger, has ventured into the past in search of the missing boy . . . never suspecting that the object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger out of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: Brianna herself. Written in My Own Heart’s Blood is the brilliant next chapter in a masterpiece of the imagination unlike any other.", ,9780385344432,Historical|Historical Fiction|Romance|Fiction|Fantasy|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Historical|Romance|Historical Romance|Audiobook|Adult|Science Fiction

Tolkien in 1955, ""though I have published little beyond the fragments in The Lord of the Rings, except The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth."" The first of the poems in The Lays of Beleriand is the previously unpublished Lay of the Children of Hurin, his early but most sustained work in the ancient English meter, intended to narrate on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. It was account of the killing by Turin of his friend Beleg, as well as a unique description of the great redoubt of Nargothrond. The Lay of the Children of Hurin was supplanted by the Lay of Leithian, ""Release from Bondage"", in which another major legend of the Elder Days received poetic form, in this case in rhyme. The chief source of the short prose tale of Beren and Luthien is The Silmarillion. This, too, was not completed, but the whole Quest of the Silmaril is told, and the poem breaks off only after the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Many years later, when The Lord of the rings was finished, J.R.R. Tolkien returned to the Lay of Leithian and started on a new version, which is also given in this book.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, Tolkien's friend and colleague, who read the poem in 1929. By assuming that this poem is actually a fragment from a past lost in history, Lewis underlined the remarkable power of its author's imaginative talents and academic competence.",First US Edition,9780395394298,Fantasy|Fiction|Poetry|Classics|Fantasy|High Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy|Epic Fantasy|Reference|Literature|Fantasy|Mythology

Beyond Sanctuary,Janet E. Morris,"In Beyond Sanctuary, the immortal Tempus and his ancient cavalry squadron take the war between magic and the gods to the mages of Wizardwall. Tempus and his Sacred Band of Stepsons begin a series of new adventures that start in Sanctuary(R) but go far “beyond,” pitting some of Thieves World's(R) most canonical characters against unforgettable villains and their own frailties while souls hang in the balance.  Love and war mix in a heady mix of ancient history and mythic fiction, love and hate, philosophy and ethos. Sacred Band pairs are forged in the crucible of the wizard wars: lovers and warriors win and lose as the hurly-burly of battle tests all loyalties. Some of Thieves' World's most popular characters stretch out and new characters are introduced in this fast-paced tale that's lyrical and lucid: the immortal Tempus and his sister; the allergic mageling Randal; the Froth Daughter Jihan, join the Sacred Band of Stepsons, fighting for freedom of the human spirit.  Beyond Sanctuary marks the emergence of the Sacred Band series of novels, as well as the first authorized and independent Thieves' World® novel. Two iconic Thieves' World stories lead naturally into this trek into farther realms of body and mind, so new readers are well grounded. Although Beyond Sanctuary stands alone, it begins a major epic and is the first of the author's three “Beyond” novels. Janet Morris stretches out and plows new ground, exploring unknown realms with Tempus and his hand-picked band of paired fighters. Demons and warlocks, witches and fiends, enemies human and inhuman clash at every turn while allegiances fracture and reform. Ancient warfare becomes reality and gods take the field with their favorites. Passion, philosophy, and high adventure make a heady, vivid mix as armies use magic and gods use the weather to harry opposing forces. When the Sacred Band and its formidable female allies finally join with the local high-peaks bandits and the storm god of the armies to assault Wizardwall itself, anything can happen – and does. War and witchery abound in this mystical adventure of love and death Beyond Sanctuary.", , ,Fantasy|Fiction|Heroic Fantasy|Sword and Sorcery|Science Fiction|Historical|Historical Fiction|Fantasy|Dark Fantasy|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Science Fiction Fantasy|War|Spirituality
