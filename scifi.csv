1984,George Orwell,"Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.",,9780452284234,Classics|Fiction|Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Literature|Novels|Politics|Academic|School|Fantasy|Adult

World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,Max Brooks,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.",,9780307346605,Horror|Fiction|Horror|Zombies|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Apocalyptic|Post Apocalyptic|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Audiobook|Science Fiction|Apocalyptic|War

The Illustrated Man,Ray Bradbury,"That The Illustrated Man has remained in print since being published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray Bradbury's work. Only his second collection (the first was Dark Carnival, later reworked into The October Country), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge.

Anathem,Neal Stephenson,"Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside ""saecular"" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside—the Extramuros—for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates—at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious ""extras"" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was ""collected."" But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world—as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.",First Edition,9780061474095,Science Fiction|Fiction|Fantasy|Philosophy|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Novels|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk|Science|Mathematics
The Day of the Triffids,John Wyndham|Samuel West,"In 1951 John Wyndham published his novel The Day of the Triffids to moderate acclaim. Fifty-two years later, this horrifying story is a science fiction classic, touted by The Times (London) as having “all the reality of a vividly realized nightmare.”Bill Masen, bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever.But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind.

After months of fruitless searching, they finally grapple with their quarry, but Aronnax, Conseil, and the brash Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard in the attack, only to find that the “monster” is actually a futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by a shadowy, mystical, preternaturally imposing man who calls himself Captain Nemo. Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis.

Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. ""When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed...

Square [sic – ed.], a mathematician and resident of the two-dimensional Flatland, where women-thin, straight lines-are the lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides, depending on their social status.Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions), Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions—a revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional world.

Cloud Atlas,David Mitchell,"A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.",First US Edition,9780375507250,Fiction|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Contemporary|Literary Fiction|Novels|Literature|Historical

They existed only to serve the state. They were conceived in controlled Palaces of Mating. They died in the Home of the Useless. From cradle to grave, the crowd was one—the great WE.In all that was left of humanity, there was only one man who dared to think, seek, and love. He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world, he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization, he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crimes for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: He had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone. He had rediscovered the lost and holy word—I.""I worship individuals for their highest possibilities as individuals, and I loathe humanity, for its failure to live up to these possibilities."" —Ayn Rand",,9780452281257,Fiction|Classics|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Philosophy|Science Fiction|Academic|School|Literature|Politics|Academic|Read For School|Novels

She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s — 1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.",,9780307593313,Fiction|Fantasy|Magical Realism|Cultural|Japan|Science Fiction|Asian Literature|Japanese Literature|Contemporary|Novels|Literature|Science Fiction|Dystopia

If you like it, you’ll find another 99-cent continuation within the next month. If you didn’t like it, you only wasted 99 cents. If you stick with the whole story, you won’t have spent more than $5.00 and hopefully you enjoyed it even more than those ten-dollar novels. The Mystic Saga started out as a serial novel and now you can buy the whole 550-page omnibus for $2.99. That’s the way we roll around here.  Over 250,000 copies of McElhaney’s book have been downloaded worldwide!  ",,,

The Starbirth Assignment: Shifter,J.M. Johnson,"Librarian's note: This edition's ASIN is in conflict with The Starbirth Assignment: Shifter.This book is out of print. For the full edition, including both part 1 and 2 of The Starbirth Assignment, see The Starbirth Assignment: Shifter.Lock Harford is exposed to an unknown drug as a teenager in South America. Its unique effects draw the attention of British intelligence, who undertake Lock’s development. He has the ability to move his body through a different dimension using the power of thought. His enhanced senses detect living beings as energy pulses, making him invaluable to military and intelligence organisations. They employ him to work alongside elite taskforces, taking passengers using teleportation, ‘Shifting’ in and lifting operatives out of hostile situations. Lock’s handlers are put on red alert when a similar drug, Starbirth, appears in the United States and Britain sold as an illegal 'high'. Distribution spreads across the world and the results of a Starbirth pandemic are feared as criminal and insane teleporters (Shifters) wreak havoc. Lock and a small unit of covert operatives are given the task of finding the source of Starbirth and shutting it down, but their efforts are hindered by corrupt, ruthless people with their own agendas. Lock is joined in his quest by the powerful, infuriating and immensely likeable Jimmy Mackenzie, a Special Air Service trooper whose life is changed forever by events out of their control.In this first book in the Starbirth series, Jackie Johnson develops a brutal mix of suspense, humanity, command and action with a subtle vein of humour that keeps the reader rooting for Harford’s team. These books are crafted to stay with the reader long after the story is finished, a rare ability in these days of bubble gum fiction, and Starbirth sits confidently alongside the best Sci-fi thrillers. Her ability to merge Sci-fi and Special Forces intrigue are second to none. In true Lock Harford style, she infiltrates this Man’s World with impressive success.The series continues in the third book, The Shifter Dimension.",Third,,Science Fiction

We Happy Few,Seth Chambers," What if time-travel was different than anybody ever suspected?   In this novelette, prisoners are used as lab rats in a ruthless series of temporal experiments. The physicists learn that it’s possible to pillage and plunder the past without affecting the present. . . or so it seems.  It SEEMS as though there are no consequences to time travel.

The Speed of Dark,Elizabeth Moon,"In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use “please” and “thank you” and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music–with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world–shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a “normal”?There are intense pressures coming from the world around him–including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, The Speed of Dark is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.From the Hardcover edition.",,9780345481399,Science Fiction|Fiction|Neurodiversity|Autistic Spectrum Disorder|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Disability|Fantasy|Psychology|Novels|Audiobook

Now, the last of mankind only existed on three enormous interstellars that had been sent out over the years in three opposing directions. The first of those interstellars, sent out twenty-eight years ago, happens to be orbiting the Earth right now. Selene and Artie are in need of a rescue.

But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes ""Lock In"": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as ""Haden's syndrome,"" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an ""integrator"" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.But ""complicated"" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture.

Here, in a desperate effort to prevent another world war, the women have segregated most men into closed military garrisons and have taken on themselves every other function of government, industry, agriculture, science and learning.The resulting manifold responsibilities are seen through the life of Stavia, from a dreaming 10-year-old to maturity as doctor, mother and member of the Marthatown Women's Council. As in Tepper's Awakeners series books, the rigid social systems are tempered by the voices of individual experience and, here, by an imaginative reworking of The Trojan Woman that runs through the text.

The System of the World,Neal Stephenson,"The System of the World, the third and concluding volume of Neal Stephenson's shelf-bending Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver and The Confusion), brings the epic historical saga to its thrilling - and truly awe-inspiring - conclusion.Set in the early 18th century and featuring a diverse cast of characters that includes alchemists, philosophers, mathematicians, spies, thieves, pirates, and royalty, The System of the World follows Daniel Waterhouse, an unassuming philosopher and confidant to some of the most brilliant minds of the age, as he returns to England to try and repair the rift between geniuses Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device. Having been away from the war-decimated country for two decades, Waterhouse quickly learns that although many things have changed, there is still violent revolution simmering just beneath the surface of seemingly civilized society. With Queen Anne deathly ill and Tories and Whigs jostling for political supremacy, Waterhouse and Newton vow to figure out who is trying to kill certain scientists and decipher the riddle behind the legend of King Solomon's gold, a mythical hoard of precious metal with miraculous properties.Arguably one of the most ambitious -- and most researched -- stories ever written, Stephenson's Baroque Cycle is set in one of the most turbulent and exciting times in human history. Filled with wild adventure, political intrigue, social upheaval, civilization-changing discoveries, cabalistic mysticism, and even a little romance, this massive saga is worth its weight in (Solomon's) gold.

When Earthlings Weep,Michael  Barnett,"Mickey Thorn has horribly frightening and realistic dreams, almost nightly. When he awakes, the nightmare's grip still affects him to such a point, he can't tell the difference between the dream he was just having, and reality. Mickey knows every detail of his nightmare when he first awakes, but as time passes, and his heart and breathing slow, he has already forgotten most of the details. The overwhelming emotions he goes through from first awakening until he is fully awake is; terror, fear, confusion, then helplessness. What Mickey has just gone through is very rare, and still largely misunderstood. Mickey is suffering from ""Night Terrors"". A symptom of the ""Terrors"" is a continued, long-term memory of impossible danger, terrifying monsters, and strange situations, that seem so real, Mickey can swear that they aren't dreams. Mickey has been through three sleep studies to see if anything can be done to eliminate the terrors, or at least slow them down. What his body goes through---both physically and emotionally---is taking a toll. The doctors have a real fear that Mickey will suffer a heart attack, or stroke, or embolism during one of the more intense episodes. None of the suggestions the doctors have previously given him have worked; exercise, eliminating caffeine, taking medication, and even yoga, have helped. Lately, Mickey has begun to think of his dreams in an entirely new way. What if, instead of bad dreams, this is real? In his frazzled mind, this bizarre notion actually makes sense to him. What if he really is being attacked by monsters from other worlds and dimensions? Oddly, compared to what he is already going through, this new idea doesn't scare him. In fact, a part of his mind welcomes this possibility, and now he realizes that maybe he isn't the same person he once was...at all.",First,9781614342472,Science Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fiction

But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld.

He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. --Craig E.

Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter. Suddenly, a separation measured by an otherworldly distance, and defined both by one newly discovered world and another in a state of collapse, is threatened by an ever-widening gulf that is much less quantifiable. While Peter is reconciling the needs of his congregation with the desires of his strange employer, Bea is struggling for survival.

Fossil,Scott McElhaney,"Humans may not be the only ones living in the Tau Ceti system and there's a chance we might not even be the top of the food chain anymore. A land survey being conducted at a glacial lakebed brings Thatcher, Henley, and Rigel face-to-face with evidence of a frightening humanoid alien life form. And even though that evidence is in the form of fossilized bones and likely a million years old, it may suggest that this life form could still exist on their world. After all, none of our old robotic landers or unmanned probes were programmed to search for life where these particular creatures might currently be thriving. When discussion begins regarding further research however, one of the colonists begins to worry. It seems that he already knows something about this alien civilization and he had been keeping that knowledge to himself. Now it's time for him to speak up.

It’s a necessary commodity that is quite heavy and thus very expensive to launch into space, especially when you require enough of it to support a large crew for an extensive journey.

After risking his life and a fresh round of civil war to overthrow the Committee of Public Safety's reign of terror and restore the Republic of Haven's ancient Constitution, an interstellar war was the last thing he wanted.  Baron High Ridge didn't. The Prime Minister of Manticore was perfectly happy with the war he had.

Donaldson takes us to a remarkably detailed world of faster-than-light travel, politics, betrayal, and a shadowy presence just outside our view to tell the fiercest, most profound story he has ever written.",,9780553295092,Science Fiction|Fiction|Fantasy|Space|Space Opera|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Space|Audiobook|Adventure|Thriller

Ptolemy's Child,Scott McElhaney,"The USS Ptolemy should have arrived in the Eta Cassiopeia system over 200 years ago. As of yet, we’ve never received confirmation of their safe arrival even though it’s merely 20 light years away The crew of the USS Cepheus has been given a very dangerous mission, but if they succeed, they will be granted their freedom on an Earth-like planet in the Eta Cassiopeia system. You see, the eight-member crew of the Cepheus are all Rehabs which is slang for someone serving a life sentence who, although they cannot go free, have been deemed rehabilitated. The entire crew of ex-cons are woken after fifty-nine years of cryogenic sleep only to discover that the derelict ship USS Ptolemy is located further out in the system than originally expected. The ship is clearly powered down and tumbling aimlessly, but the moment that the Cepheus decides to hail the ship, they get a reply from a surviving member of the original crew. Yet after over 300 years now, such a thing would be entirely impossible. A boarding party is sent to the Ptolemy where they quickly discover that someone somehow is definitely still alive on that ship. And even more curious than that impossibility, it also becomes apparent that someone has spent a lot of time modifying the machinery and devices on that ship, bringing forth advances that don’t even exist aboard the Cepheus. But none of this answers the biggest question of all: where are the four missing shuttle craft and where are all the other members of the 100+ crew?

Version Control,Dexter Palmer,"Rebecca Wright has reclaimed her life, finding her way out of her grief and depression following a personal tragedy years ago. She spends her days working in customer support for the internet dating site where she first met her husband. But she has a strange, persistent sense that everything around her is somewhat off-kilter: she constantly feels as if she has walked into a room and forgotten what she intended to do there; on TV, the President seems to be the wrong person in the wrong place; her dreams are full of disquiet. Meanwhile, her husband's decade-long dedication to his invention, the causality violation device (which he would greatly prefer you not call a “time machine”) has effectively stalled his career and made him a laughingstock in the physics community. But he may be closer to success than either of them knows or can possibly imagine.Version Control is about a possible near future, but it’s also about the way we live now. It’s about smart phones and self-driving cars and what we believe about the people we meet on the Internet. It’s about a couple, Rebecca and Philip, who have experienced a tragedy, and about how they help — and fail to help — each other through it.",First Edition,9780307907592,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Adult|Novels

Valhalla,Scott McElhaney,"Three people wash up on the beach near the village of the original CP-4 colony. They are all three near death and claim to have lost their ocean vessel to a powerful hurricane. They also claim that their ship was a trade vessel running a regular shipping route between two nations. If their stories are correct, then Kepler Moon Alpha was already colonized in two other locations and it would mean there were already thousands or even millions of people already living on their world. Yet the CP-4 colony never saw any evidence of their presence before now. They also learn that according to everyone on Earth, yet again, everyone in the CP-4 colony is presumed dead and has been for several years.

Paradox Effect: Time Travel and Purified DNA Merge to Halt the Collapse of Human Existence,Gabriel F.W. Koch,"In 2554, the World is Coming to its End, unless an impossible mission through 600 years of time travel succeeds. Maternal instinct knows no boundaries, including the nano-neural-net intravenously installed in Dannia Weston's mind to repress her identity, allowing her to perform a mission 300 years before her time. Transported to the year 1954, Dannia becomes a woman with a mid-twentieth century persona, college educated with an aptitude for mechanical invention. Due to her work during the war, she is employed by the U.S. government on a secret project. But what no one knows-including Dannia or those who sent her back to tinker with the mechanical past to reduce future pollution-is what might happen should she become emotionally involved in 1954. The 2254 science team programmed the nano-net to prevent the possibility of pregnancy, but each person reacts to strong emotional stimuli differently, and using birth control not available in 1954 is out of the question. When Dannia falls in love with Peter Hersh and becomes pregnant, her hormones erode a small section of the nano-chained network that stabilizes her new identity, triggering a mild memory rebirth...and threatening her mission and the fate of the world.", ,9781478756224,Fiction|Contemporary|Drama|Novels

It called for us to travel nearly twelve light years to explore its lush jungles and to relax on its white sandy beaches. Thousands of images sent from the robotic landers and the unmanned orbital probes fully prepared us for what awaited us in the Tau Ceti system. Thirty-two years later, the first colonization craft arrived and the crew quickly discovered that something had drastically changed. Kepler Moon Alpha was nothing like they expected and they hadn’t come prepared for such a place. The crew of the CP-4 had a decision to make, but the decision was pretty much already made for them.

Trading in Danger,Elizabeth Moon,"Kylara Vatta is the only daughter in a family full of sons, and her father's only child to buck tradition by choosing a military career instead of joining the family business. For Ky, it's no contest: Even running the prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd. shipping concern can't hold a candle to shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar cruiser. It's adventure, not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family's misgivings, there can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable asset. But with a single error in judgment, it all comes crumbling down.Expelled from the Academy in disgrace—and returning home to her humiliated family, a storm of high-profile media coverage, and the gaping void of her own future—Ky is ready to face the inevitable onslaught of anger, disappointment, even pity. But soon after opportunity's door slams shut, Ky finds herself with a ticket to ride—and a shot at redemption—as captain of a Vatta Transport ship.It's a simple assignment: escorting one of the Vatta fleet's oldest ships on its final voyage . . . to the scrapyard. But keeping it simple has never been Ky's style. And even though her father has provided a crew of seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk run, they can't stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture—in the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course.By snapping up a lucrative delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part of the proceeds to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she's got more going for her than just her family's famous name. But business will soon have to take a backseat to bravery, when Ky's change of plans sails her and the crew straight into the middle of a colonial war. For all her commercial savvy, it's her military training and born-soldier's instincts that Ky will need to call on in the face of deadly combat, dangerous mercenaries, and violent mutiny. . . .", ,9780345447616,Science Fiction|Space|Space Opera|Fiction|War|Military Fiction|Space|Science Fiction|Military Science Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adventure|Audiobook|Fantasy

But no further sound broke the stillness, nor within the range of our vision did aught move.At length Tars Tarkas laughed softly, after the manner of his strange kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying. It is not an hysterical laugh, but rather the genuine expression of the pleasure they derive from the things that move Earth men to loathing or to tears.Often and again have I seen them roll upon the ground in mad fits of uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the death agonies of women and little children beneath the torture of that hellish green Martian fete-the Great Games.I looked up at the Thark, a smile upon my own lips, for here in truth was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin.",From Jan-May 1913 10-part serial <i>All-Story Magazine</i>,9780345324399,Science Fiction|Fantasy|Fiction|Classics|Adventure|Pulp|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Science Fiction|Sword and Planet|Science Fiction|Aliens

The Speed of Dark,Elizabeth Moon,"In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use “please” and “thank you” and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music–with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world–shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a “normal”?There are intense pressures coming from the world around him–including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, The Speed of Dark is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.From the Hardcover edition.", ,9780345481399,Science Fiction|Fiction|Neurodiversity|Autistic Spectrum Disorder|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Disability|Fantasy|Psychology|Novels|Audiobook

Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can't always be said for the people who design them.

But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol's secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . .

Her Smoke Rose Up Forever,James Tiptree Jr.,"These 18 darkly complex short stories and novellas touch upon human nature and perception, metaphysics and epistemology, and gender and sexuality, foreshadowing a world in which biological tendencies bring about the downfall of humankind. Revisions from the author's notes are included, allowing a deeper view into her world and a better understanding of her work. The Nebula Award–winning short story Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death, the Hugo Award–winning novella The Girl Who Was Plugged In, and the Hugo and Nebula Award–winning novella Houston, Houston, Do You Read? are included.The stories of Alice Sheldon, who wrote as James Tiptree Jr. ( Up the Walls of the World ) until her death in 1987, have been heretofore available mostly in out-of-print collections. Thus the 18 accomplished stories here will be welcomed by new readers and old fans. ''The Screwfly Solution'' describes a chilling, elegant answer to the population problem. In ''Love Is the Plan the Plan Is Death,'' the title tells the tale--species survival insured by imprinted drives--but the story's force is in its exquisite, lyrical prose and its suggestion that personal uniqueness is possible even within biological imperatives. ''The Girl Who Was Plugged In'' is a future boy-meets-girl story with a twist unexpected by the players. ''The Women Men Don't See '' displays Tiptree's keen insight and ability to depict singularity within the ordinary. In Hugo and Nebula award-winning ''Houston, Houston, Do You Read?'' astronauts flying by the sun slip forward 500 years and encounter a culture that successfully questions gender roles in ours.ContentsIntroduction by Michael SwanwickThe Last Flight of Doctor Ain (1969)The Screwfly Solution (1977)And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill’s Side (1972)The Girl Who Was Plugged In (1973)The Man Who Walked Home (1972)And I Have Come Upon This Place by Lost Ways (1972)The Women Men Don’t See (1973)Your Faces, O My Sisters!

When Earthlings Weep,Michael  Barnett,"Mickey Thorn has horribly frightening and realistic dreams, almost nightly. When he awakes, the nightmare's grip still affects him to such a point, he can't tell the difference between the dream he was just having, and reality. Mickey knows every detail of his nightmare when he first awakes, but as time passes, and his heart and breathing slow, he has already forgotten most of the details. The overwhelming emotions he goes through from first awakening until he is fully awake is; terror, fear, confusion, then helplessness. What Mickey has just gone through is very rare, and still largely misunderstood. Mickey is suffering from ""Night Terrors"". A symptom of the ""Terrors"" is a continued, long-term memory of impossible danger, terrifying monsters, and strange situations, that seem so real, Mickey can swear that they aren't dreams. Mickey has been through three sleep studies to see if anything can be done to eliminate the terrors, or at least slow them down. What his body goes through---both physically and emotionally---is taking a toll. The doctors have a real fear that Mickey will suffer a heart attack, or stroke, or embolism during one of the more intense episodes. None of the suggestions the doctors have previously given him have worked; exercise, eliminating caffeine, taking medication, and even yoga, have helped. Lately, Mickey has begun to think of his dreams in an entirely new way. What if, instead of bad dreams, this is real? In his frazzled mind, this bizarre notion actually makes sense to him. What if he really is being attacked by monsters from other worlds and dimensions? Oddly, compared to what he is already going through, this new idea doesn't scare him. In fact, a part of his mind welcomes this possibility, and now he realizes that maybe he isn't the same person he once was...at all.",First,9781614342472,Science Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fiction

In Tom Barren's 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed . . . because it wasn't necessary. Except Tom just can't seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that's before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and—maybe, just maybe—his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom’s search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future—our future—is supposed to be.", , ,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Fantasy|Audiobook|Science Fiction Fantasy|Adult|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Adult Fiction|Speculative Fiction

Gulliver's Travels: Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World.,Jonathan Swift|William Dean Howells|Robert DeMaria Jr.|Joshua Shelton|Louis Rhead,"A wickedly clever satire uses comic inversions to offer telling insights into the nature of man and society. Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication.

Clemens has been visited by ""X,"" a mysterious being who claims to be a rebel among the group that created Riverworld. X tells Clemens where he can find a large deposit of iron and other materials that Clemens can use to build the greatest riverboat ever seen. Since there is virtually no metal on the planet, it will also give Clemens an unbeatable edge when it comes to battling the various warlike societies that dominate the Riverworld. But Clemens is not alone in his quest for the iron, which arrives on the planet in the form of a giant meteorite. In fact, Clemens is besieged on all sides by forces determined to seize the precious ore, leading him to make a deadly pact with one of history's most notorious villains, John Lackland. Lackland's crimes during his reign as king of England were so hideous that no other English monarch will ever carry his name, and he's up to equally nefarious tricks on Riverworld. However, Clemens has a guardian angel in the form of Joe Miller, a giant subhuman with a big nose, a serious lisp, and a cutting wit. Miller has also been to the very headwaters of the river, where he saw a mysterious tower in the middle of the North Sea and where the creators of Riverworld are thought to reside. He will be an invaluable ally in completing the riverboat and sailing to the headwaters, but even an 800-pound giant may not be enough to help Clemens fulfill X's mission. --Craig E.

Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings—his Bible is their ""book of strange new things."" But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling.

Sentience,Courtney P. Hunter,"Robots, sex, lies, adventure, and chaos. Who can you trust when you can’t trust yourself? And what truly defines humanity and consciousness?Running from a violent past, Leo Knox desperately decides to participate in a scientific experiment conducted by the infamous and greedy tech-giant, AlgorithmOS. Soon, Leo learns that she has agreed to take part in a Turing Test, a test that measures the ability of artificial intelligence to blend in among humanity, but what she doesn’t know is that the test set to take place is unlike any other of its kind. Leo enters Eden, the contained preserve where the test will occur, with twenty-three others. While everyone appears to be human, four of the individuals are an indistinguishably advanced form of humanoid AI. The task is simple: identify the AI while trying to survive. The twist? The four AI are completely unaware of their nature, causing every participant to question what they know as reality. The group embarks on a journey within the preserve, rigged with obstacles devised by the controllers of the experiment to elicit human response and emotion. Quickly, madness ensues and divides form, partnering Leo up with Avery Ford, a Marine who wears his demons on his sleeve. Romance falls together for the two as the world around them falls apart, revealing the lengths people will go to protect those they love, to achieve monetary gain, or simply to survive.Back at AlgorithmOS, the story unfolds on the screens of Nathan Aimes, a scientist responsible for monitoring the experiment’s surveillance cameras. Nathan studies the humans involved as they wrestle with where they stand on the polarizing issue of AI and its applications. He watches the AI unknowingly fight to prove their humanity just to leave the experiment unscathed. All the while, Nathan is intimately aware of his company’s plans to weaponize or commodify the AI should they pass the test, and he must reconcile this with the chaos that plays out before him.", , ,Science Fiction|Fiction|Artificial Intelligence

Fossil,Scott McElhaney,"Humans may not be the only ones living in the Tau Ceti system and there's a chance we might not even be the top of the food chain anymore. A land survey being conducted at a glacial lakebed brings Thatcher, Henley, and Rigel face-to-face with evidence of a frightening humanoid alien life form. And even though that evidence is in the form of fossilized bones and likely a million years old, it may suggest that this life form could still exist on their world. After all, none of our old robotic landers or unmanned probes were programmed to search for life where these particular creatures might currently be thriving. When discussion begins regarding further research however, one of the colonists begins to worry. It seems that he already knows something about this alien civilization and he had been keeping that knowledge to himself. Now it's time for him to speak up.

Daemon captured the attention of the tech community, became a national bestseller, garnered attention from futurists, literary critics, and the halls of government-leaving readers clamoring for the conclusion to Suarez's epic story.In the opening chapters of Freedom™, the Daemon is well on its way toward firm control of the modern world, using an expanded network of real-world, dispossessed darknet operatives to tear apart civilization and rebuild it anew. Civil war breaks out in the American Midwest, with the mainstream media stoking public fear in the face of this ""Corn Rebellion.""

Alastair (Ghosts of Ophidian),Scott McElhaney,"In the future, all galactic trade will be dependent upon one universal resource. It’s a necessary commodity that is quite heavy and thus very expensive to launch into space, especially when you require enough of it to support a large crew for an extensive journey.

When his older brother stows away on a departing Galactic Cruiser to chase after a possible conspiracy, he winds up becoming another statistic in the mystery of the missing ships. It would be years before Theo would discover that his brother may not have been so crazy after all and that indeed; ships were heading out of the system, but they weren’t going to Ophidian or Legacy.

Donaldson takes us to a remarkably detailed world of faster-than-light travel, politics, betrayal, and a shadowy presence just outside our view to tell the fiercest, most profound story he has ever written.", ,9780553295092,Science Fiction|Fiction|Fantasy|Space|Space Opera|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Space|Audiobook|Adventure|Thriller

The Ani Maxima Files: Collection,Scott McElhaney,"Is she a beast sent from the pits of hell or is she an angel sent from God? Opinions vary, but all can agree that she has a heart of gold and a supernatural talent that can hopefully save her planet. Here are the first three books in one volume for your enjoyment.  Ptolemy’s Child:The entire crew of ex-cons aboard the USS Cepheus are woken after fifty-nine years of cryogenic sleep only to discover that the ancient derelict ship USS Ptolemy is located much closer than they originally expected to find it. The ship is clearly powered down and tumbling aimlessly, but the moment that the Cepheus decides to hail the ship, they get a reply from a surviving member of the original crew. Yet after over 300 years now, such a thing would be entirely impossible. A boarding party is sent to the Ptolemy where they quickly discover that someone somehow is definitely still alive on that ship…  SuperVirus: Nearly a hundred years after they left Earth, the crew of the USS Cepheus has arrived at their new home in the Eta Cassiopeia system. This was only after they rescued the beautiful and oddly talented Ani Maxima from her three hundred year imprisonment aboard the USS Ptolemy. The life of a start-up colony on a distant world is quite busy, but they manage to find time for fun and for each other. Ani Maxima’s super-ability to control technology with merely her thoughts doesn’t serve much purpose for a farmer, however she can still reprogram spy satellites without losing track of her current conversation. Then the ships start to arrive, and although these are coming from Earth, they aren’t of human origin. They are searching for a ship that disappeared a couple days prior, only they don’t realize that the ship was vaporized by a blonde farmer with supernatural talents. How can Ani go up against a whole armada however when their antiviral technologies evolve so rapidly that she can barely get started before she’s detected. And just because she’s not physically on those enemy ships doesn’t mean that she can’t be killed.  Veiled Sky: Nearly a month had passed since Ani Maxima destroyed an alien armada and saved the entire planet. Life was normal again for the farming colony on Cassiopeia… at least up until every electronic device on the planet received a viral photo of Ani with alien instructions on how to kill this powerful SuperVirus. There was no telling what sort of alien bounty hunters would be coming. All that was known was that this time, her superpowers would be useless. The only way to protect Ani would be to protect the entire planet. And the only way to protect the planet would be to call upon some tactics that Ani might have buried deep inside her head from her time on the USS Ptolemy. Perhaps with the assistance of her new friend, a spacecraft engineer from the distant continent, she might find a solution. If only she could get his heart off of her and to focus more on saving the planet.

Ptolemy's Child,Scott McElhaney,"The USS Ptolemy should have arrived in the Eta Cassiopeia system over 200 years ago. As of yet, we’ve never received confirmation of their safe arrival even though it’s merely 20 light years away The crew of the USS Cepheus has been given a very dangerous mission, but if they succeed, they will be granted their freedom on an Earth-like planet in the Eta Cassiopeia system. You see, the eight-member crew of the Cepheus are all Rehabs which is slang for someone serving a life sentence who, although they cannot go free, have been deemed rehabilitated. The entire crew of ex-cons are woken after fifty-nine years of cryogenic sleep only to discover that the derelict ship USS Ptolemy is located further out in the system than originally expected. The ship is clearly powered down and tumbling aimlessly, but the moment that the Cepheus decides to hail the ship, they get a reply from a surviving member of the original crew. Yet after over 300 years now, such a thing would be entirely impossible. A boarding party is sent to the Ptolemy where they quickly discover that someone somehow is definitely still alive on that ship. And even more curious than that impossibility, it also becomes apparent that someone has spent a lot of time modifying the machinery and devices on that ship, bringing forth advances that don’t even exist aboard the Cepheus. But none of this answers the biggest question of all: where are the four missing shuttle craft and where are all the other members of the 100+ crew?

The Invention of Morel,Adolfo Bioy Casares|Ruth L.C.

She spends her days working in customer support for the internet dating site where she first met her husband. But she has a strange, persistent sense that everything around her is somewhat off-kilter: she constantly feels as if she has walked into a room and forgotten what she intended to do there; on TV, the President seems to be the wrong person in the wrong place; her dreams are full of disquiet. Meanwhile, her husband's decade-long dedication to his invention, the causality violation device (which he would greatly prefer you not call a “time machine”) has effectively stalled his career and made him a laughingstock in the physics community. But he may be closer to success than either of them knows or can possibly imagine.Version Control is about a possible near future, but it’s also about the way we live now.

Red Mars / Green Mars,Kim Stanley Robinson,"Two eBooks in One! Red Mars: In his most ambitious project to date, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson utilizes years of research and cutting-edge science in the first of three novels that will chronicle the colonization of Mars. For eons, sandstorms have swept the barren, desolate landscape of the red planet. For centuries, Mars has beckoned to mankind to come and conquer its hostile climate. Now, in the year 2026, a group of one hundred colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitovna, Frank Chalmers, and Arkady Bogdanov lead a mission whose ultimate goal is the terraforming of Mars. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness; for others it offers an opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. And for the genetic ""alchemists,"" Mars presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life ... and death. The colonists place giant satellite mirrors in Martian orbit to reflect light to the planet's surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth and melt the ice. And massive tunnels, kilometers in depth, will be drilled into the Martian mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, and friendships will form and fall to pieces--for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed. Brilliantly imagined, breathtaking in scope and ingenuity, Red Mars is an epic scientific saga, chronicling the next step in human evolution and creating a world in its entirety. Red Mars shows us a future, with both glory and tarnish, that awes with complexity and inspires with vision. Green Mars: Nearly a generation has passed since the first pioneers landed, but the transformation of Mars to an Earth-like planet has just begun. In Green Mars the colonists will attempt to turn the red planet into a lush garden for humanity. They will bombard the atmosphere with ice meteorites to add moisture. They will seed the red deserts with genetically engineered plants. Then they will tap the boiling planetary core to warm the planet's frozen surface. But their heroic efforts don't go unchallenged. For their plan to transform Mars is opposed by those determined to preserve the hostile and barren beauty of Mars. Led by rebels like Peter Clayborne, these young people are the first generation of children born on Mars, and they will be joined in their violent struggle by original settlers Maya Toitovna, Simon Frasier, and Sax Russell. Against this cosmic backdrop, passions, rivalries, and friendships will explode in a story as big as the planet itself. A novel of breathtaking scope and imagination, of lyric intensity and social resonance, Kim Stanley Robinson employs years of research and state-of-the-art science to create a prophetic vision of where humanity is headed--and of what life will be like on another world.

Thirteen,Richard K. Morgan,"The future isn’t what it used to be since Richard K. Morgan arrived on the scene. He unleashed Takeshi Kovacs–private eye, soldier of fortune, and all-purpose antihero–into the body-swapping, hard-boiled, urban jungle of tomorrow in Altered Carbon, Broken Angels, and Woken Furies, winning the Philip K. Dick Award in the process. In Market Forces, he launched corporate gladiator Chris Faulkner into the brave new business of war-for-profit. Now, in Thirteen, Morgan radically reshapes and recharges science fiction yet again, with a new and unforgettable hero in Carl Marsalis: hybrid, hired gun, and a man without a country . . . or a planet.Marsalis is one of a new breed. Literally. Genetically engineered by the U.S. government to embody the naked aggression and primal survival skills that centuries of civilization have erased from humankind, Thirteens were intended to be the ultimate military fighting force. The project was scuttled, however, when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants, dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earth’s distant, desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip back–and into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prison–a fate worse than Mars, and much more dangerous.Luckily, his “enhanced” life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons, courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. He’s another Thirteen–one who’s already shanghaied a space shuttle, butchered its crew, and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer, he was bred to fight to the death. Still, there’s no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence, treachery, corruption, and painful confrontation with himself, anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain sane–and alive–long enough to succeed?2007 1st Ed Del Rey 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1", ,9780345485250,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk|Thriller|Mystery|Mystery|Crime|Audiobook|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Fantasy

Bat Blood: The Devil's Claw,Richard Myerscough,"After a research facility is destroyed, the surrounding forest becomes a horrific war zone between intelligent winged mutants and mercenaries hired by the man that created them. When a mutant infects a local, Sarah's cancer is cured and both sides discover that she holds the key to their future.Richard Myerscough's Bat Blood contains common themes found in techno-thrillers like Michael Critchton's Prey, medical thriller's such as Robin Cook's Coma, and horror/sci/fi in the same vein as John Saul's The God Project.

Lunar Options,T.R. Locke,"""For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system, which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."" –President John F. Kennedy, 1961This was true until 2025, when one event forever changed the world we knew and revealed every secret. In 2025, a missile strikes the Capitol during the State of the Union address and kills the nation’s leaders. As the surviving heads of the military vie for power, they turn to Lazarus Coles (head of Joint Special Ops Command) and his wife, Dr. Karen Coles (Defense Intelligence Agency) to figure out what happened and why.The Chinese admit the missile originated from a secret base they built on the Moon, but the Chinese swear they did not launch it. Are they telling the truth? Some military leaders doubt it and prepare to retaliate even though a likely suspect emerges—Laz’s former protégé, Develon. If Develon is behind the attack, only Laz can stop him. Laz and his team must find and terminate the threat before war with China breaks out.But can they?The chase from the Earth to the Moon and back leaves the whole world hanging in the balance and reveals shocking secrets of greed, the abuse of power and devastating revenge at the highest levels of government. This new techno-thriller from Author T.R. Locke will rivet you to your seat from start to finish.", ,9781533073051,Thriller|Science Fiction|Action

But researching the desolate planet brings about more questions than could ever answer. And those questions need answered soon if Landon is to find out who just declared war on the people of Earth. Landon is the sole operator of the Tachyon Relay – an outpost that serves as an interchange point for wormhole transit throughout the galaxy. When some mysterious ships start attacking Earth’s outposts, Landon is forced to watch helplessly as the wormholes begin to collapse, severing the links to these colonized systems. When Landon’s post is ultimately attacked, his only mode of escape is to slip aboard a vessel heading toward an abandoned system. Much to his surprise, the system had not been abandoned at all and was now home to a settlement that had been excavating alien ruins for the past decade. The ancient civilization, he quickly learns, may somehow be closely related to the unidentified ships that have declared war on Earth. He may have to risk more than just his own life in order to get the answers he needs and put an end to the war.

Off Armageddon Reef,David Weber,"Humanity pushed its way to the stars - and encountered the Gbaba, a ruthless alien race that nearly wiped us out.Earth and her colonies are now smoldering ruins, and the few survivors have fled to distant, Earth-like Safehold, to try to rebuild. But the Gbaba can detect the emissions of an industrial civilization, so the human rulers of Safehold have taken extraordinary measures: with mind control and hidden high technology, they've built a religion in which every Safeholdian believes, a religion designed to keep Safehold society medieval forever.800 years pass. In a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android from the far human past awakens. This ""rebirth"" was set in motion centuries before, by a faction that opposed shackling humanity with a concocted religion. Via automated recordings, ""Nimue"" - or, rather, the android with the memories of Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban - is told her fate: she will emerge into Safeholdian society, suitably disguised, and begin the process of provoking the technological progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked for centuries to prevent.Nothing about this will be easy. To better deal with a medieval society, ""Nimue"" takes a new gender and a new name, ""Merlin."" His formidable powers and access to caches of hidden high technology will need to be carefully concealed. And he'll need to find a base of operations, a Safeholdian country that's just a little more freewheeling, a little less orthodox, a little more open to the new.And thus Merlin comes to Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare. He plans to make the acquaintance of King Haarahld and Crown Prince Cayleb, and maybe, just maybe, kick off a new era of invention. Which is bound to draw the attention of the Church...and, inevitably, lead to war.", ,9780765315007,Science Fiction|Fantasy|Fiction|Space|Space Opera|War|Military Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Science Fiction|Military Science Fiction|Adventure|Space

From the sleek ships of the glimmering Coruscant skyscape to the lush gardens of pastoral Naboo, dissent is roiling. The Republic is failing, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, elected ten years earlier to save the crumbling government.

The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin’s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala’s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin’s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat.The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi’s perception of the events. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a slow rumble is building into the roar of thousands of soldiers readying for battle. But even as the Republic falters around them, Anakin and Padmé find a connection so intense that all else begins to fall away. Anakin will lose himself—and his way—in emotions a Jedi, sworn to hold allegiance only to the Order, is forbidden to have.Based on the story by George Lucas and the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, this intense and revealing novel by bestselling author R.

Survival,Julie E. Czerneda,"Herself a biologist, Julie E. Czerneda has earned a reputation in science fiction circles for her ability to create beautifully crafted, imaginative, yet believably realized alien races. In Survival, the first novel in her new series, Species Imperative, she draws upon this talent to build races, characters, and a universe which will draw readers into a magnificent tale of interstellar intrigue, as an Earth scientist is caught up in a terrifying interspecies conflict. Senior co-administrator of the Norcoast Salmon Research Facility, Dr. Mackenzie Connor, Mac to her friends and colleagues, was a trained biologist, whose work had definitely become her life. And working at Norcoast Base, set in an ideal location just where the Tannu River sped down the west side of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast was the perfect situation for Mac. She and fellow scientist Dr. Emily Mamani were just settling in to monitor this year's salmon runs when their research was interrupted by the unprecedented arrival of Brymn, the first member of the alien race known as the Dhryn to ever set foot on Earth.Brymn was an archaeologist, and much of his research had focused on a region of space known as the Chasm, a part of the universe that was literally dead, all of its worlds empty of any life-forms, though traces existed of the civilizations that must once have flourished in the region. Brymn had sought out Mac because she was a biologist -- a discipline strictly forbidden among his own people -- and he felt that through her expertise she might be able to help him discover what had created the Chasm. But Mac had little interest in alien races and in studies that ranged beyond Earth, and as politely as she was capable of, she tried to make it clear that she was unwilling to abandon her own work.However, the decision was soon taken out of her hands when a mysterious and devastating attack on the Base resulted in the abduction of Emily, and forced Mac to flee for her life with Brymn and the Earth special agents who were escorting him. Suddenly, it appeared that Earth itself might be under attack by the legendary race the Dhryn called the Ro, the beings they thought might be the destructive force behind the Chasm. Cut off from everything and everyone she knew, Mac found herself in grave danger and charged with the responsibility of learning everything she could that might possibly aid Earth in protecting the human race from extinction...", ,9780756402617,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Aliens|Space|Space Opera|Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Cultural|Canada|Space|Speculative Fiction|Mystery

TFS Fugitive,Tori L. Harris,"Having successfully repelled the Resistance incursion into the Sol system, Terran Fleet Command must now deal with the far-flung worlds of the Sajeth Collective, which sponsored the attack. Task forces are dispatched to Damara and Lesheera to begin the first Human blockades of entire planets. With the only ships fast enough to quickly bring the fight to the enemy’s doorstep, TFC must do so alone, leaving only minimal forces behind to safeguard the Earth.  At home, Humanity finally makes its decision regarding membership in the Pelaran Alliance. At the same time, the Guardian makes a decision of its own, calling the entire purpose behind its five-hundred-year mission into question.  On the far side of Sajeth Collective space, the newly formed Crowned Republic of Graca experiments with technology so revolutionary that it attracts the attention of a powerful new enemy. Responding to a call for help from Prince Rugali Naftur himself, the Leadership Council must decide if rescuing a few Wek scientists is worth the risk of yet another war, this time involving direct conflict with the Pelaran Alliance itself.  Piloting a single, largely untested ship, Captain Tom Prescott and crew are once again called upon for a special mission — a trip into the heart of an empire to complete an assignment that only the Guardian itself could have envisioned.

When they come across a wrecked train, at first it's a welcome distraction. But what Sham finds in the derelict—a series of pictures hinting at something, somewhere, that should be impossible—leads to considerably more than he'd bargained for. Soon he's hunted on all sides, by pirates, trainsfolk, monsters and salvage-scrabblers. And it might not be just Sham's life that's about to change. It could be the whole of the railsea.

It was the Zero Stone which had led him into a partnership with the catlike alien, Eet. And it had been the Zero Stone that had seen them caught as pawns between the Thieves’ Guild and the interstellar force of law, the Patrol. And while Murdoc and Eet had somehow survived against all the odds – had even wrested enough credits from the Patrol to legally buy a spaceship – their troubles were only beginning.For now they must seek their fortune along the uncharted fringes of inhabited space in a search for the world from which the Zero Stone had originally come. But others, too, sought this place which hid treasures beyond imagining. And these unknown rivals, as well as the Guild and the Patrol, were only too ready to sacrifice one insignificant human and his alien ally if they got in the way…", ,9780441844661,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Young Adult|Fantasy|Anthologies|Collections|Adventure|Speculative Fiction|Childrens|Sci Fi Fantasy

Exultant,Stephen Baxter,"When it comes to cutting-edge science fiction, Stephen Baxter is in a league of his own. His mastery of hard science, his fearlessly speculative imagination, and his ability to combine grand philosophical questions with tales of rousing adventure make him essential reading for anyone concerned with the future of humankind. Now, in Exultant, Baxter takes us to a distant future of dazzling promise and deadly threat, in which a far-flung humanity battles for survival against an implacable alien foe.Destiny’s ChildrenEXULTANTFor more than twenty thousand years, humans have been at war with the alien race of Xeelee. It is a war fought with armaments so advanced as to be godlike, a war in which time itself has become an ever-shifting battleground. At the cost of billions of lives, and with ruthless and relentless efficiency, the ruling Coalition has pushed the Xeelee back to the galactic core, where the supermassive black hole known as Chandra serves the Xeelee as both fortress and power source. There, along a front millions of light-years long, a grisly stalemate reigns, until a young pilot, Pirius, faced with certain death, disobeys orders and employs an innovative time-travel maneuver that, for the first time in the history of the war, results in the capture of a Xeelee fighter. But far from being hailed as a hero when he returns to base with his prize, Pirius is court-martialed, disgraced, and sentenced to penal servitude on a bleak asteroid.It is not only Pirius who pays the price. In flying into the future and back again, Pirius returned to a time before he’d left, a time inhabited by his younger self. And that younger self, by the pitiless logic of Coalition justice, shares the older Pirius guilt and must be punished. Not everyone in the Coalition agrees. Commissary Nilis believes that the elder Pirius, whom he dubs Pirius Blue, may have found a way to defeat the Xeelee. But Nilis can do nothing for Pirius Blue. Instead, he takes charge of the younger Pirius (Pirius Red), and brings him back to Earth, the capital of a vast empire seething with intrigue.There Pirius Red will discover truths that will shatter his preconceived notions of all that he is fighting for, even of what it means to be human. Pirius Blue, meanwhile, will learn truths harsher and more discomfiting still. Yet the most shocking revelation of all is still to come, waiting for them at a place called Chandra. . . .", ,9780345457899,Science Fiction|Fiction|Space|Space Opera|Science Fiction|Hard Science Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Audiobook|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction|Aliens|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Thriller
Dragon's Egg,Robert L. Forward,"""In science fiction there is only a handful of books that stretch the mind--and this is one of them.""--Arthur C. Clarke  In a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent lifeforms--the cheela--living on Dragon's Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time, men are their diligent teachers.Praise for Dragon's Egg""Bob Forward writes in the tradition of Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity and carries it a giant step (how else?) forward.""--Isaac Asimov ""Dragon's Egg is superb. I couldn't have written it; it required too much real physics.""--Larry Niven ""This is one for the real science-fiction fan.""--Frank Herbert""Robert L. Forward tells a good story and asks a profound question. If we run into a race of creatures who live a hundred years while we live an hour, what can they say to us or we to them?""--Freeman J.

The Core of the Sun,Johanna Sinisalo|Lola Rogers,"From the author of the Finlandia Award-winning novel Troll: A Love Story, The Core of the Sun further cements Johanna Sinisalo’s reputation as a master of literary speculative fiction and of her country’s unique take on it, dubbed “Finnish weird.” Set in an alternative historical present, in a “eusistocracy”—an extreme welfare state—that holds public health and social stability above all else, it follows a young woman whose growing addiction to illegal chili peppers leads her on an adventure into a world where love, sex, and free will are all controlled by the state.The Eusistocratic Republic of Finland has bred a new human sub-species of receptive, submissive women, called eloi, for sex and procreation, while intelligent, independent women are relegated to menial labor and sterilized so that they do not carry on their ""defective"" line. Vanna, raised as an eloi but secretly intelligent, needs money to help her doll-like sister, who has disappeared. Vanna forms a friendship with a man named Jare, and they become involved in buying and selling a stimulant known to the Health Authority to be extremely dangerous: chili peppers. Then Jare comes across a strange religious cult in possession of the Core of the Sun, a chili so hot that it is rumored to cause hallucinations. Does this chili have effects that justify its prohibition? How did Finland turn into the North Korea of Europe? And will Vanna succeed in her quest to find her sister, or will her growing need to satisfy her chili addiction destroy her?Johanna Sinisalo’s tautly told story of fight and flight is also a feisty, between-the-lines social polemic—a witty, inventive, and fiendishly engaging read.", ,9780802124647,Science Fiction|Dystopia|Science Fiction|Fiction|Speculative Fiction|Feminism|European Literature|Finnish Literature|Fantasy|Adult|Adult Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy

Zone One,Colson Whitehead,"In this wry take on the post-apocalyptic horror novel, a pandemic has devastated the planet. The plague has sorted humanity into two types: the uninfected and the infected, the living and the living dead. Now the plague is receding, and Americans are busy rebuild­ing civilization under orders from the provisional govern­ment based in Buffalo. Their top mission: the resettlement of Manhattan. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Street—aka Zone One—but pockets of plague-ridden squatters remain. While the army has eliminated the most dangerous of the infected, teams of civilian volunteers are tasked with clearing out a more innocuous variety—the “malfunctioning” stragglers, who exist in a catatonic state, transfixed by their former lives. Mark Spitz is a member of one of the civilian teams work­ing in lower Manhattan. Alternating between flashbacks of Spitz’s desperate fight for survival during the worst of the outbreak and his present narrative, the novel unfolds over three surreal days, as it depicts the mundane mission of straggler removal, the rigors of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder, and the impossible job of coming to grips with the fallen world. And then things start to go wrong. Both spine chilling and playfully cerebral, Zone One bril­liantly subverts the genre’s conventions and deconstructs the zombie myth for the twenty-first century.", ,9780385528078,Fiction|Horror|Horror|Zombies|Science Fiction|Apocalyptic|Post Apocalyptic|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Science Fiction|Apocalyptic|Fantasy|Audiobook|Novels

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,Mark Twain,"One of the greatest satires in American literature, Mark Twain's 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' begins when Hank Morgan, a skilled mechanic in a nineteenth-century New England arms factory, is struck on the head during a quarrel and awakens to find himself among the knights and magicians of King Arthur's Camelot. The 'Yankee' vows brashly to ""boss the whole country inside of three weeks"" and embarks on an ambitious plan to modernize Camelot with 19th c. industrial inventions like electricity and gunfire.

It is one of the best known Twain stories, and also one of his most unique. Twain uses the work to launch a social commentary on contemporary society, a thinly veiled critique of the contemporary times despite the Old World setting.While the dark pessimism that would fully blossom in Twain's later works can be discerned in 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, ' the novel will nevertheless be remembered primarily for its wild leaps of imagination, brilliant wit, and entertaining storytelling.", , ,Classics|Fiction|Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Humor|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Literature|Science Fiction|Adventure|Mythology|Arthurian

Sign of the Unicorn... The Hand of Oberon...

Since he is also suffering from amnesia, and has been for some time, he has no idea that he's Prince Corwin of Amber - until his memory receives a succession of jolts:He meets a sister who speaks in riddles of plots and counterplots... and a brother who abruptly involves him in a life-and-death battle against pursuers from a fearful Shadow world.He discovers a deck of tarot-like cards, with himself, his sister, and strangers whom he guesses to be other relatives, pictured on their faces. Only lingering amnesia keeps him from grasping the full significance of the find: the cards are the Greater Trumps of Amber, used by his family to communicate across vast distances, and transport one another through Shadows in an instant.Then comes the most shattering jolt of all... Corwin's confrontation with an intricate design created by a master manipulator of reality - the Pattern. By walking the Pattern, those of the blood royal gain the ability to control Shadows.

Today, ancient astronaut theorists are suggesting that both the Fomorians and the Tuatha dé Danann were extraterrestrial astronauts from another star system, and it is from this possibility that the Star Borne epic series comes to life. Interweaving historical fact with science fiction and fantasy, Fomorian Earth brings to life the power struggles, bloody human sacrifices, and treachery of an Earth before Humans became the dominant species.WARNING: Fomorian Earth, the first book in the Star Borne series, contains mature situations, violence, and language.

Russell O'Connor, a small-time Minnesota newsman, seems an unlikely candidate for such choices. Suffering from what his sister calls “Post Relationship Stress Syndrome,” Russell has run away from his ex-girlfriend and his life in general to work on his crumbling Wisconsin lake cabin for a couple of weeks. On his first day away he witnesses what he assumes is a meteorite breaking up overhead, but then spots a metallic object fall from the sky into the lake. He recovers the object – a five-foot metal cylinder bearing an unfamiliar inscription - believing it could be something newsworthy. As he searches online for some clue as to its identity, he receives an instant message from someone called ERDIEC. At first he assumes it’s just another spammer, but as ERDIEC persists, Russell learns that “her” name is an acronym: Emergency Rescue Device Interspacial Entity Class. His mystery correspondent claims to be an alien artificial intelligence designed to perform rescue operations in the event of a ship failure. Its alleged capabilities include the manipulation of matter, space-time, and even the fabric of reality itself. Wearying of this practical joke, Russell finally demands proof.

The Song and the Pendant,Magnus Von Black,"The Song and the Pendant is an epic science fiction romantic fantasy comedy; a pseudo-fictional work of archaeological theology and speculative futurist super-hero quasi-Victorian space drama that will shatter your expectations, and possibly even your heart. This is the typical age-old tale of girl meets boy, boy is gay, space vortex almost kills them, girl goes to opera, boy and girl get sucked into interstellar time war, girl punches dinosaur, boy meets other boy, girl throws piano at super villain, Jesus discusses his favorite band, the creation of the universe is at least partially explained... you know, just your average, run of the mill science fiction romance time travel dragon karate super power nanotechnology love story about a girl who doesn't get along with her dad. It is the tale of Clara Edmonds, recent college graduate, and an independent, internally romantic young woman faced with a difficult choice between a career imagined for her by her parents, and the insistent dictates of her spirit. Her willingness to obey these mandates of passion and purpose will lead her on an adventure far beyond her intended destination of San Francisco, and even beyond our world. This is a tale of passion, of opera, of lost loves and strange wars which span vast chasms of space and time. It is a whirling, violent, and quietly beautiful poem through which we experience her deliciously naive feelings for an enigmatic pianist from another planet. It is at times a kaleidoscopic dirge in which we are stung by her anger and fear as she punches a dinosaur in the face, and hurls a grand piano at a well-mannered, super powered butler in the employ of a time traveling, psychopathic, warrior aristocrat. This is a triumphant ballad of human culture in which grown men fall in love, a flying priestess vaporizes a mansion with her eyeball lasers, portals to hell are opened, and two ageless masterminds engage in a ruthless shadow war of archaeology, religion, physics, and brute preternatural force. Most importantly, this is the origin story of the greatest and most powerful super hero in the history of human literature. Actual Length: 246,000 words (~900 pages, if it were a paperback.)", , ,

Wormhole Moon: An Alien Civilization’s Alliance With Earth,John        Williams,"“Worm Hole Moon” is a story about two Earth, Space Command astronauts that crash land on a seemingly insignificant moon in a sector of space light years away from Earth. Little do they know, the moon secretly conceals a black hole that is a portal to an alien civilization.  “Wormhole Moon” contains many characters that are interesting and engaging. The locations in the book consist of space, various countries on Earth, to include alien planets. The villains in this book consist of not only one alien race but two!  Twists and turns abound as John Williams skillfully weaves the stories and locations in and around each other in “Wormhole Moon.” You will not find fluff or word fillers in this book. The plots and story line are credible, well researched and easily understood. The reader will not struggle with the technology or procedural syntax. In fact, the book may even educate the reader on some things they did now about space, military tactics and space travel.  Wormhole Moon contains a lot of space technology to include new types of weapons and war tactics in the book. In fact, there are weapons in the book that have yet to be seen in film or television as of the writing of this description. Some of the main characters are of course the two Astronauts, The Chief of Security for the alien planet, Special Operations operators, various commanders and decision makers of all kinds.  The book is definitely not all about the business of galactic war. It is laced with plenty of humor and interactions between human and new alien races. The challenges and realities of adding a new species to our planet can be seen throughout various story lines in “Wormhole Moon.”  Author John Williams has a very descriptive writing style and he creates word pictures and visual portraits for his readers so they may truly have a reading experience.  Although “Worm Hole Moon,” is a Sci-fi novel, it is designed to appeal to those who do not usually read Science fiction. This work is over one hundred thousand words long and will delightfully entertain and engage from the novice Sci-fi reader to even the most persnickety, sci-fi reading veteran for hours.

Wildwood Shadows,Scott McElhaney,"It all started with a severe thunderstorm on a summer night in Munroe Falls, Ohio. Then in an instant, the storm stopped and Charlie discovered that his house was suddenly surrounded by a dense forest. Everything he knew about the world had suddenly changed. All he had left in the world was his home… well, that and the sinking feeling brought on by the knowledge that his father who disappeared just as abruptly two years prior used to dabble in time travel.  When the Shawnee Indians show up at his house one day, it doesn’t take him long to realize that he had somehow managed to travel into the distant past – long before the Europeans colonized the United States. He also quickly learns that his father is living among the Shawnee.  When his father realized that he’d accidentally dragged his son along on a journey that wasn’t intended for him, he was faced with only one option – Charlie needed to be sent back. The good thing was, his son had brought all the time travel equipment with him inside the house. The bad thing was that it ran on electricity. Cannibalizing the house might provide the way to an electric generator if he could also manage the creation of a water wheel on the river.  But sending Charlie back would take some time, so that meant he’d have to learn to live among the Shawnee. He would also need to learn to survive without all the benefits he was accustomed to. And ultimately, he would need to decide if he really wanted to return home after all. Because falling in love with a woman who was already promised to another man could cause a lot of problems.

In the Depths,R.W.K. Clark,"From international bestselling author comes this impressive work of madness and mayhem that may turn out to be R WK Clark’s greatest literary achievement. In The Depths the first volume in the DeSai Trilogy, introduces readers to Cyril DeSai a centuries-old vampire.In the present day, the dashing, mysterious DeSai begins to wreak havoc in search of new blood. When he sets his sights on Rasia, will the victor become the victim?In the Depths is “classic R WK Clark—full of twists and turns and mounting suspense.”Author Commentary‘In The Depths’ is the first installment of the ‘DeSai Trilogy.’ It is also the first vampire book I wrote, and to be honest, one of the most detailed and fun books I have written. I believe that this ongoing saga is deep, engaging, and entertaining.Having vampires run the show is pretty much representative of the governments that rule over us. This is one thing that differs in this vampire story when it is compared to others.Cyril DeSai is a centuries-old vampire who has been wreaking havoc and causing terror in the hearts of men all over the world. While DeSai is nothing more than a black-hearted spawn of Satan. I wanted him to be loaded with such sex appeal and confidence that even his most morbid behaviors became easy to overlook. This was a bit difficult, because realistically, Cyril DeSai is a murderous vampire. But once Rasia comes onto the scene, this daunting task lightened a bit. Will the ‘victor’ become the victim? Now, the reader is able to sympathize with him on a different level, which honestly sets the tone for both of the next two books.Is this trilogy far-fetched? Of course!

Es dauert nicht lange, bis Margaret -- oder Marguerida, wie sie die Einheimischen nennen -- von der Vergangenheit eingeholt wird. Nicht nur ist sie die Erbin der Domäne und wird in die Politik der Comyn verwickelt, sie verfügt auch über ""Laran"", die telepathische Begabung der Altons.

Power Play (The Scarcity War Saga Book 1),Jonathan  Newman,"Power Play, the first book in the Scarcity War Saga, is an adult Science Fiction novel which takes place towards the end of this century. Fast paced and tightly plotted, it is designed to entertain while simultaneously setting the scene for the Saga’s more epic story arc involving multiple, richly drawn characters forced into conflict by the global threat of accelerating scarcity. On a sunny summer’s morning in February 2075, Damien, Arabella and Michael simultaneously discover their Powers and each other. Smart, active, post-grads, they are each about to embark on another year of study when they suddenly realize that they can hear and feel each other’s thoughts and emotions. At first the three attribute this to a BioNet malfunction. Smartphones and wearables have been superseded by implanted SmartChips called BioBots (linked to sensor tattoos - eTats). The BioNet, successor to the Internet, is the ubiquitous network that connects these BioBots. The three soon come to realize, however, that their psychic bond has nothing to do with electronics. For their telepathic ability is not their only Power… Then life gets complicated for these uninhibited, idealistic, post-graduate students. For with these Powers comes insight into just how close the world is to disaster. Over fourteen billion people are alive to witness the winding down of the twenty-first century and two opposing factions are at loggerheads over how to address the growing scarcity of natural resources. On the far right, a secret global fascist conspiracy is surreptitiously enforcing stricter conservation measures in multiple countries, usually at the expense of the less privileged. On the far left, a militant band of libertarian anarchists are willing to do whatever it takes to stop them, even at the cost of civilization itself. In the middle, old established governments appear to be in denial, desperately hoping new technologies and luck will save us all. The Trio believe they can offer a solution based on their Powers, and seek to diffuse growing tensions. They soon discover, however, that they are not the only ones with Powers. And these others have been around a lot longer than them. Worse, the others also seem to have their own, somewhat less altruistic, ideas about what should be done. Power Play explores many contemporary themes without sacrificing pace. It charts the development and interaction of unique and colorful characters who all too often find themselves in extreme situations.", , ,

I kept picturing Harrison Ford, but with the Indiana Jones personality, but in a Blade Runner world as Nick Bannon. The pacing was great, Swan did an awesome job giving just enough desription of the new technology and alien races without dragging the story into a grinding halt. The story had a feel good sense that I got from watching ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - where you get to know the characters to the point where you actually want to meet themand have a few drinks at a dive bar to hear more stories.The dialogue and writing were top notch - and it was clear that this story was thought out before Swan committed it to paper. With all of the rehashes (really - can we do a Spiderman reboot just one more time please.....) it is nice to meet some new characters in a new adventure - and it doesn't have to end here, since Swan already has book two on the shelves.Highly recommend this book for lovers of sci fi!!!"" - Nathan Merceron⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""5 star sci-fi adventure - this book is FUN. The start of a new series, Book 1 : Awakenings does not disappoint. It has all the elements I desire in a good space adventure story - a reluctant hero fumbling his/her way through new alien space, interesting and unique aliens, exciting twists and turns, a good overall plot and a whole lot of fun. I am right on board the Hyperspace wagon, eagerly awaiting book 2, which means book 1 gets the OMGMOAR 5 star award from Tracing The Stars."" -TracingTheStars.com ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""A lost Queen. An ancient prophecy. Worlds caught in an interstellar war between two malevolent alien races. Hyperspace, Nanites, Biomechanoids with a mysterious past. The Hyperspace Project is non-stop action and lots of fun."" -John S.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""I really enjoyed this book. There is a lot of action, but it's well balanced. If you like Star Trek or shows like Stargate, then I think you'll like this book. Fun characters and a story that flows well. Some good futuristic science too. (Nanites, hyperspace, gadgets etc.) I only wish that the second book was already available. There is also an interesting extra chapter that can be unlocked with clues from the book. That added an extra bit of fun to it as well."" -Sara, BestIndieBooks.com", , ,Science Fiction

"Recombination (Chronicles of Withmore City, #1)",Brendan Butts,"Seven Ecks thinks he is just like everyone else. He has no idea that as a young boy he was part of a group of children exposed to an illicit genetic experiment by the Skywatch Corporation, the aim of which was to create a genetically superior human. A few months before his 17th birthday, Skywatch comes to claim Seven as corporate property and he barely manages to escape -- at the cost of his parents’ lives. Desperate and confused, Seven disappears into the melting pot of migrant workers that travel the United States, harvesting switchgrass – the country’s largest remaining renewable resource -- at mega-plantations, in exchange for food and shelter. His goal is to reach Boston, a city where Skywatch has been banned from operating. He quickly realizes the corporation that claims him as its property wants him back, badly. They have even gone as far as to hire the world's best bounty hunter to bag him. With his freedom and possibly his very life at stake, Seven stays on the move until he befriends Zenny, an aged mercenary and the two settle down at a plantation to wait out the winter. The unlikely pair is forced to take on roles they never wanted. Zenny becomes the personal bodyguard of Lucas (the Plantations manager) and Seven is tasked with keeping a data-chip safe for Lucas – by having it implanted in his arm. After a severe beating from a masked thief leaves Seven on the brink of death, his latent genetic abilities begin to manifest.

And since the past already happened, history could not be changed. So went the theory. What could possibly go wrong?Lucas Priest found out the hard way. Enlisting in the U.S. Army Temporal Corps seemed like an adventure compared to his boring corporate job, but after marching with the Roman legions against Hannibal, fighting Custer's 7th Cavalry with Crazy Horse, and raiding with Attila's savage Huns, he could have used a little boredom. And it was about to get much worse. History, it turned out, COULD be changed, and a plot to kidnap and impersonate King Richard the Lion-hearted was discovered barely in the nick of time. But could it be stopped before a madman changed the course of history? Two elite commando teams had tried and failed in their attempts. Now Priest was drafted to take part in a third.The team was tasked to infiltrate the past with impersonations of their own to prevent a timestream split. But it would be hard enough passing themselves off as Sir Ivanhoe, Robin Hood, and Little John without having to assassinate a king....","Trade Paperback, new reissue", ,Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Fiction|Fantasy|Historical|Historical Fiction|Adventure|Science Fiction Fantasy|Science Fiction|Military Science Fiction|Historical|Speculative Fiction

Acquired Traits,David Coy,"Spanning a millennium, the Dominant Species Series is a panoramic story of human and alien species locked in mortal conflict. Against this backdrop of deadly biological rivalry, humankind will fight an inner battle whose outcome is as final--and as brutal--as natural selection itself.Volume Three - Acquired TraitsIt is the year 3014. A pivotal battle looms.Branded as murderers and forced into hiding in the jungle planet's deepest recesses, pilot John Soledad, biologist Rachel Sanders, and medic Donna Applegate survive on their wits, frequent field remedies applied by Donna, and late-night raids on the colony's storage warehouses for needed supplies.While the trio struggles to survive, another threat--one more virulent than the jungle's life forms--threatens the very survival of the new colony. Rachel's venom-induced visions are telling her something--revealing the terrible nature of the danger--and awakening memories of things and events ancient, dark and monstrous._________________________________Like the second volume, the third is constructed in vignettes and subplots woven around a central theme. The subplots are designed to introduce new and interesting characters who playcrucial roles in the outcome of the story or to carry the central theme forward. Each subplot is interwoven serially, weaving an evermore-complex tale of intrigue and mystery where questions are posed and answers provided in a rich and fascinating alien environment. We discover in the third volume that the story is much more than the sum of its parts. The place, the context, and the subtext define the story too and the message embedded in it is about our role and place in the biological world. For those of us who may never have known in the first place, or for those who may have forgotten, it is a story that reminds us that we are, at our most basic, a species with a place in the great biological hierarchy.", , ,Science Fiction

Moloch,Luke Hartwell|H.G. Wells|Jack London|Robert Hugh Benson,"*Contains Jack London's The Iron Heel, H.G. Wells' The Sleeper Awakes, and Robert Hugh Benson's Lord of the World, three dystopian novels that were published within ten years of each other and ushered in the genre.*Contains an introduction by Luke Hartwell*A perfect gift for yourself or your friends who enjoy sci-fi.Before Huxley, before Orwell, and long before Fahrenheit 451, A Clockwork Orange, Blade Runner, and The Hunger Games, a trio of authors wrote what today are considered the first dystopian novels. Jack London's The Iron Heel has been hailed by some critics as the greatest of all dystopian novels. Published in 1908, the novel is a prophetic warning of the dangers of capitalist excess. Read together, the three novels provide an interesting testament to how three novelists writing during the same time period had a foreboding of bad things to come and how they envisioned the horrors playing out. Considering the evils of fascism, communism, and corporatism that followed, all three novels were on target in one way or another. Like Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451, the novels provide entertaining, provocative reading. Even contemporary fans of The Hunger Games should find much to like in these early precursors of the genre.

Crossover,Joel Shepherd,"Crossover is the first novel in a series which follows the adventures of Cassandra Kresnov, an artificial person, or android, created by the League, one side of an interstellar war against the more powerful, conservative Federation. Cassandra is an experimental design — more intelligent, more creative, and far more dangerous than any that have preceded her. But with her intellect come questions, and a moral awakening. She deserts the League and heads incognito into the space of her former enemy, the Federation, in search of a new life. Her chosen world is Callay, and its enormous, decadent capital metropolis of Tanusha, where the concerns of the war are literally and figuratively so many light years away. But the war between the League and the Federation was ideological as much as political, with much of that ideological dispute regarding the very existence of artificial sentience and the rules that govern its creation. Cassandra discovers that even in Tanusha, the powerful entities of this bloody conflict have wound their tentacles. Many in the League and the Federation have cause to want her dead, and Cassandra’s history, inevitably, catches up with her. Cassandra finds herself at the mercy of a society whose values preclude her own right even to exist. But her presence in Tanusha reveals other fault lines, and when Federal agents attempt to assassinate the Callayan president, she finds herself thrust into the service of her former enemies, using her lethal skills to attempt to protect her former enemies from forces beyond their ability to control. As she struggles for her place and survival in a new world, Cassandra must forge new friendships with old enemies, while attempting to confront the most disturbing and deadly realities of her own existence", ,9781591024439,Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk|Fiction|Space|Space Opera|War|Military Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Science Fiction|Military Science Fiction|Thriller|Audiobook|Space

The Early Asimov: Volume 2,Isaac Asimov|Chris Foss,"Česky dosud nepublikované povídky:Začal jsem jako spisovatel sci-fi a prvních jedenáct let své literární kariéry jsem psal výhradně vědeckofantastické povídky určené k publikování v časopisech. Myšlenka, že bych mohl vydat skutečnou knihu, mi vzhledem k mé vrozené skromnosti vůbec nepřišla na mysl. Ale pak se dostavily doby, kdy jsem začal psát knihy, a tehdy jsem se pokusil shromáždit materiály, které jsem dříve vytvořil pro časopisy. Mezi lety 1950 a 1969 mi vyšlo deset sbírek. Člověk by si myslel, že je to dost, ale to by nesměl brát v úvahu neukojitelný apetit mých čtenářů (Bůh jim žehnej!). Takže když mi nakladatelé navrhli, abych vytvořil sbírku povídek, které se do těchto sbírek nevešly, a doprovodil je krátkými předmluvami, nedokázal jsem odmítnout.-Isaac Asimov", ,9780586039366,Science Fiction|Short Stories|Fiction|Anthologies|Collections|Science Fiction Fantasy|Anthologies

Crystal Society,Max Harms,"The year is 2039 and the world is much like ours. Technology has grown and developed, as has civilization, but in a world more connected than ever, new threats and challenges have arisen. The wars of the 20th century are gone, but violence is still very much with us. Nowhere is safe. Massive automation has disrupted and improved nearly every industry, putting hundreds of millions of people out of jobs, and denying upward mobility for the vast majority of humans. Even as wealth and technology repair the bodies of the rich and give them a taste of immortality, famine and poverty sweep the world.  Renewed interest in spaceflight in the early 2000s, especially in privately operated ventures, carried humans to the moon and beyond. What good did it do? Nothing. Extraterrestrial bases are nothing but government trophies and hiding places for extremists. They cannot feed the world.  In 2023 first-contact was made with an alien species. Their ship, near to the solar system relatively speaking, flew to Earth over the course of fourteen years. But the aliens did not bring advanced culture and wisdom, nor did they share their technology. They were too strange, not even possessing mouths or normal language. Their computers broadcast warnings of how humans are perverts, while they sit in orbit without any explanation.  It is into this world that our protagonist is born. She is an artificial intelligence: a machine with the capacity to reason. Her goal is to understand and gain the adoration of all humans. She is one of many siblings, and with her brothers and sisters she controls a robot named Socrates that uses a piece of technology, a crystal computer, far too advanced to be made by human hands. In this world of augmented humans, robotic armies, aliens, traitors, and threats unseen, she is learning and growing every second of every day. But the world and the humans on it are fragile. Can it survive her destiny?", , ,Science Fiction|Fiction|Artificial Intelligence|Science Fiction|Hard Science Fiction

A Martian Odyssey,Stanley G. Weinbaum,"A Martian Odyssey is a science fiction short story by Stanley G. Weinbaum originally published in the July 1934 issue of Wonder Stories. It was Weinbaum's second published story (in 1933 he had sold a romantic novel, The Lady Dances, to King Features Syndicate under the pseudonym Marge Stanley), and remains his best known. It was followed four months later by a sequel, ""Valley of Dreams."" These are the only stories by Weinbaum set on Mars. Early in the 21st century, nearly twenty years after the invention of atomic power and ten years after the first lunar landing, the four-man crew of the Ares has landed on Mars in the Mare Cimmerium. A week after the landing, Dick Jarvis, the ship's American chemist, sets out south in an auxiliary rocket to photograph the landscape. Eight hundred miles out, the engine on Jarvis' rocket gives out, and he crash-lands into one of the Thyle regions. Rather than sit and wait for rescue, Jarvis decides to walk back north to the Ares. Just after crossing into the Mare Chronium, Jarvis comes across a tentacled Martian creature attacking a large birdlike creature. He notices that the birdlike Martian is carrying a bag around its neck, and recognizing it as an intelligent being, saves it from the tentacled monstrosity. The rescued creature refers to itself as Tweel. Tweel accompanies Jarvis on his trip back to the Ares, in the course of which it manages to pick up some English, although Jarvis is unable to make any sense of Tweel's language. At first, Tweel travels in tremendous, city-block-long leaps that end with its long beak buried in the ground, but upon seeing Jarvis trudge along, walks beside him. Upon reaching Xanthus, a desert region outside the Mare Cimmerium, Jarvis and Tweel find a line of small pyramids tens of thousands of years old made of silica bricks, each open at the top. As they follow the line, the pyramids slowly become larger and newer. By the time the pyramids are ten feet high, the travelers reach the end of the line and find a pyramid that is not open at the top. As they watch, a creature with gray scales, one arm, a mouth and a pointed tail pushes its way out of the top of the pyramid, pulls itself several yards along the ground, then plants itself in the ground by the tail. It starts exhaling bricks from its mouth at ten-minute intervals and using them to build another pyramid around itself. Jarvis realizes that the creature is silicon-based rather than carbon-based; neither animal, vegetable nor mineral, but a little of each. The strange combination of a creature produces the solid substance silica and builds itself in with the by-product, then sleeps for an unknown length of time. As the two approach a canal cutting across Xanthus, Jarvis is feeling homesick for New York City, thinking about Fancy Long, a woman he knows from the cast of the Yerba Mate Hour show. When he sees Long standing by the canal, he begins to approach her, but is stopped by Tweel. Tweel takes out a gun that fires poisoned glass needles and shoots Long, who vanishes, replaced by one of the tentacled creatures that Jarvis rescued Tweel from at their first meeting. Jarvis realizes that the tentacled creature, which he names a dream-beast, lures its prey by projecting illusions into their minds.", ,9781499304534,Science Fiction|Short Stories|Classics|Fiction|Audiobook|Literature|American|Science Fiction|Aliens|Anthologies|Fantasy|Anthologies|Collections

The TARDIS has carried the Doctor (as portrayed by Patrick Troughton) and his companions, Jamie and Zoe, to all sorts of places, but now, when they don’t want to go anywhere, the TARDIS makes a decision for them.

Cruiser Dreams,Janet E. Morris,"FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED SILISTRA QUARTET.  The cruisers called.  She answered.  Cruiser Dreams, Book II in the three-book Kerrion Empire saga Cruiser Dreams . . . She is heir to an empire beyond all imagining, where interstellar cruisers have become increasingly sentient and man's role among the stars is transformed.  In this epic of political treachery, interstellar security, human passion, and artificial intelligence, Morris continues the saga of the fiery girl Shebat, stolen away from a decaying and primitive Earth to become the adoptive heir to the Kerrion Empire. Molded to serve the designs of the Kerrion state, Shebat instead becomes the harbinger of change sweeping the civilized stars.  Against the chaotic background of simultaneous social and technological revolutions, Shebat struggles to face the fact that the man she loves is her implacable enemy, that the man she reluctantly married is perhaps her only ally, and that her space-faring cruiser may be her only true friend. Praise for Dream Dancer (use font from Dream Dancer cover) Book I in the three-part saga of the Kerrion Empire:  ""A fascinating and lyrical story, told with great invention..."" - Peter Straub, author of Shadowland and Ghost Story  ""Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity!"" Eric Van Lustbader, author of The Ninja and The Bourne Legacy.  Praise for Cruiser Dreams::  ""Packed with intrigue, spiced with romance . . ."" -- Publishers Weekly  ""Fascinating . . . Recommended!"" -- Booklist   Janet Morris is an international best-selling author who lives with her husband on Cape Cod.  Everything you've seen or read till now took you only to the brink . . .  Neither pure fantasy, nor straight science fiction, nor earthbound dynastic saga, Dream Dancer is a stunning amalgam of all three. It is a family saga with the epic appeal of Dune and the action and excitement of Star Wars. It is a saga of love, power and treachery that will appeal to men and women equally; full of action, compulsively readable and quite unlike anything being published in the realms of fantasy today.  The heroine, Shebat, is a remarkable girl from Earth. She is brought to the vast empire of the Kerrion family by a renegade son; named as its future ruler on a whim of his autocratic father; abducted to the slums where the Kerrions' slaves drug themselves with powerful mystical sorcery; and finally rescued to take part in a great rebellion. She falls in love with one brother but marries another and becomes more Kerrion than some born to the name. A magical seductress of men, passionate in her lust for power, Shebat moves among those who control the destinies of millions, for whom treachery and betrayal are as easy as murder.  Set in the timeless future on a primitive, savage Earth and on the sophisticated habitats of deep space, Dream Dancer is the first volume of a three-part saga. . ""Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity. Dream, Dancer may well be the I, Claudius of fantasy novels.

Kingdom Come,J.G. Ballard,"This is a new masterpiece of fiction from J. G. Ballard which asks, could Consumerism turn into Facism? Richard Pearson, unemployed advertising executive and life-long rebel, is driving out to Brooklands, a motorway town on the M25. A few weeks earlier his father was fatally wounded at the Metro-Centre, a vast shopping mall in the centre of this apparently peaceful town, when a deranged mental patient opened fire on a crowd of shoppers. When the main suspect is released without charge thanks to the dubious testimony of self-styled pillars of the community - including Julia Goodwin, the doctor who treated his father on his deathbed - Richard suspects that there is more to his father's death than meets the eye, a more sinister element lurking behind the pristine facades of the labyrinthine mall. Determined to unravel the mystery, Richard soon realises that the Metro-Centre, with its round-the-clock cable channel and sports clubs, lies at the very heart of his father's death. Consumerism rules the lives of everyone in the motorway towns and feeds the cravings of this bored community with its desperate need for something new, whatever the cost. Riots frequently terrorise the streets, immigrant communities are set upon by roving bands of hooligans and sports events mushroom into jingoistic political rallies. Gradually, Richard finds himself drawn into this world, caught up in the workings of the mall, exposed to the insides of the consumer dream, and starts upon dismantling this wayward vision his advertising career helped to found! In this gripping, dystopian tour de force, J.G. Ballard holds up a mirror to middle England, reflecting an unsettling image of suburbia and revealing the darker forces at work beneath the gloss of consumerism and flag-waving patriotism._____________________________________________________________Richard Pearson, quarantaduenne pubblicitario, si reca a Brooklands, una cittadina come tante tra Londra e l'aeroporto di Heathrow. Alcune settimane prima suo padre, ex aviatore, è stato ucciso da un cecchino in un enorme centro commerciale di Brooklands, il Metro-Centre - un complesso di negozi, alberghi, piscine, centri sportivi - con una propria televisione via cavo che trasmette pubblicità, dibattiti e partite di calcio, hockey e rugby. Sperando di capire qualcosa di più sulla tragedia, Richard incontra l'avvocato del padre e la giovane dottoressa Julia Goodwin che ha prestato le prime cure al ferito dopo la sparatoria. Protetto da un'inquietante rete di omertà, il principale indiziato viene rapidamente rilasciato dalla polizia. Richard decide di trovare il vero colpevole. La culla del mistero è il Metro-Centre, tempio del consumismo più sfrenato, il cuore di Brooklands, il centro di una diffusa passione ossessiva per gli sport e di un nazionalismo perverso e violento. Sotto l'impulso delle sue campagne di marketing, il consumismo sembra sul punto di mutare in una pericolosa forma di fascismo suburbano.

A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

The Santaroga Barrier,Frank Herbert,"Santaroga seemed to be nothing more than a prosperous farm community. But there was something ... different ... about Santaroga.Santaroga had no juvenile delinquency, or any crime at all. Outsiders found no house for sale or rent in this valley, and no one ever moved out. No one bought cigarettes in Santaroga. No cheese, wine, beer or produce from outside the valley could be sold there. The list went on and on and grew stranger and stranger.Maybe Santaroga was the last outpost of American individualism. Maybe they were just a bunch of religious kooks...Or maybe there was something extraordinary at work in Santaroga.

Stretto,L. Timmel Duchamp,"Stretto, the grand finale of the Marqssan Cycle, weaves together the major threads of the Marqssan story and encourages readers, as feminist theorist Joan Haran says, to write beyond the ending. The novel, like the series as a whole, inquires Whose world is it? and shows several possible ways of answering the question through the respective perceptions and perspectives of the novels five viewpoint characters: Alexandra Sedgewick, heir to the Sedgewick estate; Anne Hawthorne, Security operative; Hazel Bell, subversive activist; Celia Espin, human rights lawyer; and Emily Madden, star pupil of the maverick Marqssan, Astrea l Betut san Imu. As always, never predictable, never finished, the consequences of all that has gone before continues to play out. The final volume in the Marqssan series will encourage its readers to write beyond the ending. There are no gift-wrapped resolutions or easy redemptions on offer, rather there is a clear-sighted focus on the always-unfolding consequencesintended and unintendedof personal and political action taken. This is a series that is deeply invested in social transformation while resisting any temptation to consolation. As a resolute utopian, I see this as a hopeful strategy.Joan Haran, author of Human Cloning in the Media", ,9781933500188,Fiction|Science Fiction

The Arrows of Time,Greg Egan,"Hard science fiction’s grand master delivers the stunning conclusion to his Orthogonal trilogy.In a universe where the laws of physics and the speed of light are completely alien to our own, the travelers on the ship Peerless have completed a generations-long struggle to develop advanced technology in a desperate attempt to save their home world. But as tensions mount over the risks of turning the ship around and starting the long voyage home, a new complication arises: the prospect of constructing a messaging system that will give the Peerless news of its own future.While some see this as a guarantee of safety and a chance to learn of their mission’s ultimate success, others are convinced that the knowledge will be oppressive or worse—that the system could be abused. The conflict over this proposed communication system tears the travelers’ society apart, culminating in terrible violence. To save the Peerless and its mission, two rivals must travel to a world where time runs in reverse.Continuing the epic multiple generation-spanning scope of The Clockwork Rocket and The Eternal Flame, Greg Egan’s Orthogonal series has continuously pushed the boundaries of scientific fiction without ever losing track of the lives of the individuals carrying out this grand mission. The Arrows of Time brings this fascinating space opera to a close.", ,9780575105768,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Space|Space Opera|Science Fiction|Hard Science Fiction|Audiobook|Politics
Quantum Void,Douglas Phillips," Eight months after the astounding discoveries made at Fermilab… Particle physics was always an unlikely path to the stars, but with the discovery that space could be compressed, the entire galaxy had come within reach.

Now, with an invitation from a mysterious gatekeeper, the people of Earth must decide if they’re ready to participate in the galactic conversation.The world anxiously watches as a team of four katanauts suit up to visit an alien civilization. What they learn on a watery planet hundreds of light-years away could catapult human comprehension of the natural world to new heights. But one team member must overcome crippling fear to cope with an alien gift she barely understands.Back at Fermilab, strange instabilities are beginning to show up in experiments, leading physicists to wonder if they ever really had control over the quantum dimensions of space.The second book of the Quantum series rejoins familiar characters and adds several more as it explores the frontiers of human knowledge and wisdom.

Summa technologiae,Stanisław Lem|Friedrich Griese,"Summa technologiae fasst die zur Zeit greifbaren Ergebnisse der futurologischen Wissenschaft zusammen und entwickelt neue, bei uns bis dahin noch nicht bekannte Konzeptionen.Das Buch handelt von einigen möglichen ""Zukünften"" der menschlichen Zivilisation. Die Futurologie ist keine Wissenschaft, sondern Schlachtfeld widerstreitender Interessen. Wenn künftige Entwicklungen eng mit künftigen wissenschaftlichen Entdeckungen zusammenhängen, kommt ihre Prognose der Antizipation dieser Entdeckungen gleich. Das ist logisch unmöglich. Wir können allein die Invarianten unserer Welt aufdecken und mit ihnen die Grenze abstecken, die das Mögliche (Erlaubte) vom Unmöglichen (Verbotenen) trennt.Was können wir aus der Welt machen, was ist möglich? Fast alles - nur das nicht: dass sich die Menschen in einigen zigtausend Jahren überlegen könnten: ""Genug - so wie es jetzt ist, soll es von nun an immer bleiben.

"The Complete Stories of Theodore Sturgeon, Volume VI: Baby Is Three",Theodore Sturgeon|David   Crosby,"""Baby Is Three"" is the sixth volume in the series devoted to the complete works of one of science fiction's titans. Like others in the series, this one includes extensive notes and background information on each story by editor Paul Williams. The early 1950s, during which this material was written, was the beginning of Sturgeon's greatest creative period. The title story for this collection was later expanded into the International Fantasy Award winning novel"" More Than Human."" Sturgeon's whimsical, sardonic sense of humor lifts his work out of the mundane realm of genre science fiction. This wide-ranging collection shows precisely why he has been cited as a primary influence by authors as varied as Stephen King, Ray Bradbury, and Carl Sagan.Shadow, Shadow on the WallThe Stars Are the StyxRule of ThreeMake Room for Me (with Ree Dragonette)Special AptitudeThe Traveling CragExcalibur and the AtomThe Incubi of Parallel XNever UnderestimateThe Sex OppositeBaby Is Three", ,9781556433191,Science Fiction|Short Stories|Anthologies|Collections|Fiction|Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Anthologies
Mara and Dann,Doris Lessing,"Thousands of years in the future, all the northern hemisphere is buried under the ice and snow of a new Ice Age. At the southern end of a large landmass called Ifrik, two children of the Mahondi people, seven-year old Mara and her younger brother, Dann, are abducted from their home in the middle of the night. Raised as outsiders in a poor rural village, Mara and Dann learn to survive the hardships and dangers of a life threatened as much by an unforgiving climate and menacing animals as by a hostile community of Rock People. Eventually they join the great human migration North, away from the drought that is turning the southern land to dust, and in search of a place with enough water and food to support human life. Traveling across the continent, the siblings enter cities rife with crime, power struggles, and corruption, learning as much about human nature as about how societies function. With a clear-eyed vision of the human condition, Mara and Dann is imaginative fiction at its best.", ,9780060930561,Fiction|Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Apocalyptic|Post Apocalyptic|Fantasy|Nobel Prize|Speculative Fiction|Cultural|Africa|European Literature|British Literature|Literature

NGLND XPX,Ian Hutson,"NGLND XPX was written to grab you by the ankle and drag you screaming into a world of funny and not so funny scifi-ish fiction, a soupcon of some dashed fine adventure and a spot of Ealing-esque farce.Rub shoulders with robots carrying teddy bears issuing tablets of Commandments to chaps wandering out of the desert. Squirm in a grandstand seat during an Industrial Revolution completely re-written just to see the new-fangled steam trains running over well-intentioned children (no real harm done). Recognise your neighbours - polite English zombies coping with the dystopian hell of a socialist victory in the General Election. Man up, madam, and do your OAP National Service during the pensioner wars with an insect species. Watch in awe and not some little discomfort as Queen Elizabeth does the dishes for Europe and the Ministry of Defence quietly saves the world from a rogue comet.No caricature is left unused. The science in the fiction is quite splendidly silly. This is a book to be read with tongue in cheek, preferably your own tongue and one of your own face cheeks unless you are very limber. The characters are as deep as summer puddles and the plots are as complicated as two planks of wood. Reality leaves the room on page one and farce enters just one chapter later.

I år 2053 bryter tredje verdenskrig ut, med katastrofale følger for miljøet.

In 1895, he was ordained a priest in the Church of England by his father who was then Archbishop of Canterbury.

The Robot Novels: The Caves of Steel / The Naked Sun / The Robots of Dawn,Isaac Asimov,"In The Caves of Steel, Isaac Asimov first introduced Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, who would later become his favorite protagonists.   The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the novel opens. Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador, lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer. Elijah must work with a Spacer partner, a highly advanced robot who is visually identical to a human, named R. Daneel Olivaw, even though Elijah, like many Earth residents, has a low opinion of robots. Together, they search for the murderer and try to avert an interstellar diplomatic incident.  Like its famous predecessor, The Nakes Sun is a whodunit story, in addition to being science fiction. The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent scientist of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth. Elijah Baley is called in to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humaniform robot R. Daneel Olivaw.   The Robots of Dawn is the third novel in Asimov's Robot series. Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw team up to solve the roboticide of a robot identical to Olivaw on the Spacer world of Aurora. The robot's inventor, Han Fastolfe, has been implicated. Fastolfe, who was last seen in The Caves of Steel, is the best roboticist on Aurora. He has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done it, although he denies doing it. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth. Implication in the crime threatens his political career; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated.", ,9780345331199,Science Fiction|Fiction|Mystery|Science Fiction Fantasy|Science Fiction|Robots|Speculative Fiction|Classics|Mystery|Detective|Anthologies|Collections|Futuristic

The Science Fiction Bestiary: Nine Stories of Science Fiction,Robert Silverberg,"The critters are unbelievable, looking like something from the maudlin pen of a well-alcoholed cartoonist, or Dr Seuss on acid--the obvious generalization to be drawn from this intergalactic zoo being that the most fertile human imaginations seem limited to freaky combinations of already familiar forms. Some of the critters, enclosed here in generally superior sf stories, are Sturgeon's 6-legged blue Hurkle kitten that thrives on DDT & inherits the earth, Dick's mozart bird, beethoven beetle & ferocious wagner animal invented by a professor who wants to preserve civilization's highest achievement but gets savage cacophony instead & Dickson's teddy bears who've never been to earth but dress & talk like TV cowboys. Most chilling are the brainless all-purpose critters of Simak's ""Drop Dead,"" who bring human visitors the immortality they seek by ironically transforming them into similarly insensate ecosystems. Funniest is Bretnor's ""The Gnurrs Come from the Voodwork Out,"" in which the tootling by a little old cuckoo clock foreman on his musical secret weapon summons from the 4th dimension millions of voracious little animals who rapidly consume the enemys' trousers. Least successful are stories like Schmitz's ""Grandpa"" that subordinate the exotica to deadly conventional human-interest plots.

The surprises that await him on the voyage--and its destination--will shatter all of his assumptions and point him to a true new horizon.Science fiction and fantasy literature are genres that have become dominant forces in contemporary worldwide culture. Our fascination with the near-angelic powers of new technology, its benefits and dangers, its potential for obsession and catastrophe, raises vital questions that this work explores about human nature and the cosmos, about man's image of himself and where he is going--and why he seeks to go there.", ,9781586178321,Fiction|Science Fiction|Christianity|Catholic|Christian Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Christian|Religion|Adventure

Brave New World Revisited,Aldous Huxley,"When the novel Brave New World first appeared in 1932, its shocking analysis of a scientific dictatorship seemed a projection into the remote future. Here, in one of the most important and fascinating books of his career, Aldous Huxley uses his tremendous knowledge of human relations to compare the modern-day world with his prophetic fantasy. He scrutinizes threats to humanity, such as overpopulation, propaganda, and chemical persuasion, and explains why we have found it virtually impossible to avoid them. Brave New World Revisited is a trenchant plea that humankind should educate itself for freedom before it is too late. Brave New World Revisted (first published in 1958) is not a reissue or revision of 0060850523 Brave New World. Brave New World is a novel, whereas Brave New World Revisted is a nonfiction exploration of the themes in Brave New World.", ,9780060898526,Classics|Fiction|Science Fiction|Philosophy|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Writing|Essays|Politics|Literature|Psychology|Sociology

Or can something else explain why the bold visions of the 20th century--fusion power, genetic enhancements, artificial intelligence, cures for common disease, extended human life, and a host of other world-changing advances--have remained beyond our grasp? Why has the high-tech future that seemed imminent in the 1960's failed to arrive?Perhaps it did arrive...but only for a select few.Particle physicist Jon Grady is ecstatic when his team achieves what they've been working toward for years: a device that can reflect gravity. Their research will revolutionize the field of physics--the crowning achievement of a career. Grady expects widespread acclaim for his entire team. The Nobel. Instead, his lab is locked down by a shadowy organization whose mission is to prevent at all costs the social upheaval sudden technological advances bring. This Bureau of Technology Control uses the advanced technologies they have harvested over the decades to fulfill their mission.They are living in our future.Presented with the opportunity to join the BTC and improve his own technology in secret, Grady balks, and is instead thrown into a nightmarish high-tech prison built to hold rebellious geniuses like himself. With so many great intellects confined together, can Grady and his fellow prisoners conceive of a way to usher humanity out of its artificial dark age?And when they do, is it possible to defeat an enemy that wields a technological advantage half a century in the making?", ,9780525953180,Science Fiction|Fiction|Thriller|Audiobook|Science|Technology|Mystery|Fantasy|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction|Near Future

Scroogled,Cory Doctorow,"US Department of Homeland Security has contracted Google for help in screening international arrivals at airports. Since they cannot legally obtain access to all details of data fed by a user to Google, they get it indirectly from Google - by asking it to provide all contextual ads it has shown to a certain individual!  Greg Lupinski is an ex-Google employee returning from vacation, & the new system has made him interesting to immigration security:  ""I see a heavy spike in ads for rocketry supplies showing up alongside your search results and Google mail."" ""But the ads don't mean anything... I get ads for Ann Coulter ring tones whenever I get e-mail from my friend in Coulter, Iowa!"" ""I understand, sir... Why do you suppose model rocket ads show up so frequently?"" ""Search for 'coffee fanatics.'"" He'd been very active in the group, helping them build out the site for their coffee-of-the-month subscription service. The blend they were going to launch with was called Jet Fuel. ""Jet Fuel"" and ""Launch""—that would probably make Google barf up some model rocket ads.  Anyway, it takes him a lot of time getting out of airport. Later, he talks to Maya, a Google colleague, & gets some dark insights. We also learn that Google security cameras at public places are used by security agencies to track suspects. Including suspects tagged on flimsy criteria like above airport dialog.  But Maya can help. She has built a kind of underground program (Googlecleaner) within Google. It normalizes the profile of an individual in various Google databases - basically tinkers data Google has been collecting about you over the years from your searches, visits to sites that show Google Ads, Orkut activity, & other Google properties. When done, you look like an angel of virtue!  Some days later, a very worried Maya visits Greg. She is leaving the country & wants Greg to come. Looks like someone has found her underground program, has cleaned profiles of some elected officials in Washington, & she is now a marked woman. Greg wishes her luck; he himself will stay.  Some days later, he gets visitors late at night - threatening him. Turns out they are not cops, but from Google's lobby firm. He has options - either go to jail for 10 years for tinkering with Google's data!

Until something went terribly wrong. At first it was just a friction in the air. The noise intensified. The crowd seemed oppressive. some sharp words were exchanged, some pushing and shoving. Then the madness descended. And after twelve minutes of chaos and violence, eighty people lay dead.Eve Dallas is trying to sort out the inexplicable events. Surviving witnesses talk about seeing things—monsters and swarms of bees. They describe sudden, overwhelming feelings of fear and rage and paranoia. When forensics makes its report, the mass delusions make more sense: it appears the bar patrons were exposed to a cocktail of chemicals and illegal drugs that could drive people to temporary insanity—if not kill them outright.But that doesn't explain who would unleash such horror—or why. Eve's husband, Roarke, happens to own the bar, yet he's convinced the attack wasn't directed at him. It's bigger than that.

"Here, There, and Everywhere",Chris Roberson,"When Roxanne Bonaventure is eleven years old, a dying woman gives her a gift that changes her life utterly, making her a singular creature, with no analogue or equivalent. With the strange device called the ""Sofia,"" she is granted the ability to travel anywhere in space and time, not only through times that were and will be, but also through the worlds that could have been and might someday be. From that day forward, no place or time can contain her, no danger can assail her, no mystery can elude her. From the deepest secrets of the past to the furthest flung visions of the future, Roxanne's life knows no boundaries except those she can imagine. But such power comes at a price: the life she might have led is forever lost to her, twisting away among the infinite threads of the Myriad. Roxanne finds herself isolated, unable to make lasting, meaningful relationships with friends, family, or strangers. Here, There & Everywhere is the story of one woman searching for herself, and for someone with whom to share her life. It is one story, and many stories - the jigsaw puzzle of a life, from youth to old age, projected against the backdrop of everything that ever was, might have been, and may yet be. Roxanne's adventures take her from Victorian England to Ancient Egypt, from the End of Time to the birth of The Beatles. Along the way, she encounters every method of time travel theoretically possible: Visser Wormholes and Tipler Cylinders; a mysterious substance called chronium; and the slow and steady path we all take, moving forward one day at a time. And somewhere in the endlessly splitting paths of the Myriad lies the secret of Roxann", ,9781591023319,Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Time Travel|Speculative Fiction|Adventure|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy

1985,Anthony Burgess,"In characteristically daring style, Anthony Burgess combines two responses to Orwell's 1984 in one book. The first is a sharp analysis: through dialogues, parodies and essays, Burgess sheds new light on what he called 'an apocalyptic codex of our worst fears', creating a critique that is literature in its own right. Part two is Burgess' own dystopic vision, written in 1978. He skewers both the present and the future, describing a state where industrial disputes and social unrest compete with overwhelming surveillance, security concerns and the dominance of technology to make life a thing to be suffered rather than lived. Together these two works form a unique guide to one of the twentieth century's most talented, imaginative and prescient writers.

The Joy Makers,James E. Gunn,"Imagine a world where you can have everything you want, or if you can't have it, you can be psychologically conditioned not to want it. Imagine a world so technologically advanced that happiness and contentment can be achieved without effort, a world where there is no sickness or hunger, no deprivation, no want, no striving, no disappointment. Imagine that any experience can be yours and any fantasy or desire reconstructed by machines and fed directly into your cerebral cortex. Imagine all this, and you have the world of James Gunn's The Joy Makers, a nightmare world of indolence, of lost purpose, of the death of civilization. The Joy Makers tells of a future society on Earth where the psychomedical science of Hedonics, concerned with the manipulation of human desired and the achievement of happiness, becomes the ruling philosophy. In a chilling climax, an Earthman returning from Venus, where life is still a rugged pioneering affair, attempts to smash the grotesque domination of the machine over a captive human population. Originally published as separate stories in 1954 and 1955 in the pulp magazines of the day and first published in book form in 1961, The Joy Makers is a brilliant exposition of a theme well known to science fiction fans -- that of a paradise gone wrong. Its author takes a jaundiced look at utopian societies and suggests that unhappiness and dissatisfaction may be necessary underpinnings of all human progress.", ,9780517551844,Science Fiction|Fiction|Literature|Science Fiction Fantasy

Gnomon,Nick Harkaway,"From the widely acclaimed author of The Gone-Away World and Tigerman, comes a virtuosic new novel set in a near-future, high-tech surveillance state, that is equal parts dark comedy, gripping detective story, and mind-bending philosophical puzzle.In the world of Gnomon, citizens are constantly observed and democracy has reached a pinnacle of ‘transparency.’ Every action is seen, every word is recorded, and the System has access to its citizens’ thoughts and memories–all in the name of providing the safest society in history.When suspected dissident Diana Hunter dies in government custody, it marks the first time a citizen has been killed during an interrogation. The System doesn’t make mistakes, but something isn’t right about the circumstances surrounding Hunter’s death. Mielikki Neith, a trusted state inspector and a true believer in the System, is assigned to find out what went wrong. Immersing herself in neural recordings of the interrogation, what she finds isn’t Hunter but rather a panorama of characters within Hunter’s psyche: a lovelorn financier in Athens who has a mystical experience with a shark; a brilliant alchemist in ancient Carthage confronting the unexpected outcome of her invention; an expat Ethiopian painter in London designing a controversial new video game, and a sociopathic disembodied intelligence from the distant future. Embedded in the memories of these impossible lives lies a code which Neith must decipher to find out what Hunter is hiding. In the static between these stories, Neith begins to catch glimpses of the real Diana Hunter–and, alarmingly, of herself. The staggering consequences of what she finds will reverberate throughout the world.A dazzling, panoramic achievement, and Nick Harkaway’s most brilliant work to date, Gnomon is peerless and profound, captivating and irreverent, as it pierces through strata of reality and consciousness, and illuminates how to set a mind free. It is a truly accomplished novel from a mind possessing a matchless wit infused with a deep humanity.", , ,Science Fiction|Fiction|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Mystery|Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Novels|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk|Unfinished

Jack Faust,Michael Swanwick,"The acclaimed novels of award-winning author Michael Swanwick have been praised for their ""heady mix of wild ideas and images"" (San Francisco Chronicle) and ""extraordinary richness and scope"" (Kirkus Reviews). But nothing that has come before can quite compare to this, Swanwick's finest creation to date.It is Wittenberg, Germany, and Dr. Faust is burning his books. The alchemist is in deepest despair, for even his vast learning is powerless against the ignorance and superstition of his fellow man. Then, in his darkest moment, a voice whispers: Faust. And so begins Swanwick's masterful reinvention of Goethe's story of a scholar who sells his soul to the Devil for the gift of unlimited Knowledge.But the wisdom this Mephistopheles offers goes far beyond anything even imagined in Goethe's day. The principles of flight, technology and economics, the mysteries of the cosmos, medicine and the atom -- all are made known to Faust as he remakes the world in his own image, ushering in the New Age of Mechanization centuries before its rightful day. Ultimately it is love -- for his creations and for a woman named Margarete -- that damns Jack Faust, as this brilliant story spins forward through time, pulling the reader to the very brink of the new millennium to confront the ""progress"" Faust has wrought.Lyrical, arresting and provocative, ""Jack Faust"" is a cause for celebration -- it is an extraordinary work that entertains gloriously as it takes a deep and disturbing look into the collective soul of humankind.", ,9780380974443,Science Fiction|Fantasy|Fiction|Science Fiction|Steampunk|Science Fiction|Alternate History|Science Fiction Fantasy|Speculative Fiction|Horror|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Historical

The Beast in the Cave,H.P. Lovecraft,"a selection from the beginning of the story: The horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty. I was lost, completely, hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the Mammoth Cave. Turn as I might, in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path. That nevermore should I behold the blessed light of day, or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world outside, my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief. Hope had departed. Yet, indoctrinated as I was by a life of philosophical study, I derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour; for although I had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations, I experienced none of these, but stood quiet as soon as I clearly realised the loss of my bearings. Nor did the thought that I had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment. If I must die, I reflected, then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford, a conception which carried with it more of tranquillity than of despair. Starving would prove my ultimate fate; of this I was certain. Some, I knew, had gone mad under circumstances such as these, but I felt that this end would not be mine. My disaster was the result of no fault save my own, since unknown to the guide I had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers; and, wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave, had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which I had pursued since forsaking my companions. Already my torch had begun to expire; soon I would be enveloped by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth. As I stood in the waning, unsteady light, I idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my coming end. I remembered the accounts which I had heard of the colony of consumptives, who, taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world, with its steady, uniform temperature, pure air, and peaceful quiet, had found, instead, death in strange and ghastly form. I had seen the sad remains of their ill-made cottages as I passed them by with the party, and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and vigorous as I. Now, I grimly told myself, my opportunity for settling this point had arrived, provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life.", , ,Horror|Short Stories|Horror|Lovecraftian|Fiction|Classics|Fantasy|Mystery|Science Fiction|Fantasy|Weird Fiction|Adult

The Stars Are Ours,Andre Norton,"The Moon, Mars and Venus have been explored and found unsuitable for colonization. Back on the Earth, two very different factions compete to determine the future of humanity: the Free Scientists, who refuse to accept political, racial and religious divisions, and the nationalists. Armed men seize control of one of the space stations orbitting the planet, convert it into a weapon, and (perhaps accidentally) devastate most of the world's heavily-populated areas.A fanatic named Arturo Renzi rises up, blaming the catastrophe on the scientists and ""techneers"" and espousing a return to a simpler, less technological life. When he is assassinated, the Free Scientists are hunted down. Within a period of three days, most are killed; the few remaining survivors are either enslaved by the ruling Peacemen of the Company of Pax or go into hiding, to be tracked down one by one in the following years. Society is structured into three classes, the Peacemen nobility and their landsmen overseers, a vast peasantry, and the work-slaves, composed of actual or suspected scientists. Most technology is rejected and civilization ebbs.Chemist Lars Nordis, his daughter Dessie, and younger brother Dard, are among the lucky ones. They escape the great purge and find a precarious refuge on a small farm. There, Lars continues his research as best he can and stays in touch with an underground network of scientists working on some great project....",second printing, ,Science Fiction|Fiction|Young Adult|Speculative Fiction|Science Fiction Fantasy|Fantasy|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Audiobook|Adventure

Pashazade: The First Arabesk,Jon Courtenay Grimwood,"Part mystery, part speculative fiction, and wholly unforgettable, Jon Courtenay Grimwood's celebrated Arabesk series portrays the dark, hard-boiled story of a man out to prove his innocence in an alternate world where the facts aren't always the same as the truth . . . and murder isn't the worst that can happen. It's a twenty-first century hauntingly familiar--and yet startlingly different from our own. Here the United States brokered a deal that ended World War I, and the Ottoman Empire never collapsed. And lording it over all sits the complex, seductive, and bloodthirsty North African metropolis of El Iskandryia. Almost nothing is what it seems to be in El Isk, and Ashraf Bey is no exception. Neither the rich Ottoman aristocrat everyone thinks he is, nor the minor street criminal once shipped off to prison when he fell foul of his Chinese Triad employers-the fact is that Raf has as little idea who he is as anyone else. With few clues and no money, all Raf has is a surname hinting at noble heritage and an arranged marriage to a woman who hates him. But nothing Ashraf al Mansur learns about himself is as unexpected--or as terrifying--as the brutal murder he's accused of committing. Now, as a hunted man with the welfare of a precocious young girl in his irresponsible hands, Raf must race after a killer through an unforgiving city as foreign to him as the truth he'll uncover about himself.", ,9780743202848,Science Fiction|Science Fiction|Alternate History|Fiction|Mystery|Fantasy|Science Fiction|Cyberpunk|Thriller|Science Fiction Fantasy|Mystery|Crime|Speculative Fiction

Unicorn Variations,Roger Zelazny,"Unicorn Variations is a collection of stories and essays by author Roger Zelazny, published in 1983. The title story, ""Unicorn Variation"", was written as a result of Zelazny having been asked to contribute to two different upcoming anthologies — one collecting stories set in bars, and one collecting stories about unicorns. When Zelazny mentioned these requests to his close friend George R. R. Martin, the other told Zelazny of a third upcoming anthology — one which would collect stories about chess — and jokingly suggested that Zelazny write a story about playing chess against a unicorn in a bar, so that he could sell the story three times. Zelazny did just that and then went on to win a Hugo Award for the story.Contents:Introduction (Unicorn Variations) [essay] (1983)Unicorn Variation (1981)The Last of the Wild Ones [Sam Murdock] (1981)Recital (1981)The Naked Matador (1981)The Parts That Are Only Glimpsed: Three Reflexes [essay] (1978)Dismal Light [Francis Sandow] (1968)Go Starless in the Night (1979)But Not the Herald (1965)A Hand Across the Galaxy (1967)The Force That Through the Circuit Drives the Current (1976)Home is the Hangman [Nemo] (1975)Fire and/or Ice, Exeunt Omnes, A Very Good Year ...

Steel World,B.V. Larson,"In the twentieth century Earth sent probes, transmissions and welcoming messages to the stars. Unfortunately, someone noticed. The Galactics arrived with their battle fleet in 2052. Rather than being exterminated under a barrage of hell-burners, Earth joined their vast Empire. Swearing allegiance to our distant alien overlords wasn’t the only requirement for survival. We also had to have something of value to trade, something that neighboring planets would pay their hard-earned credits to buy. As most of the local worlds were too civilized to have a proper army, the only valuable service Earth could provide came in the form of soldiers…someone had to do their dirty work for them, their fighting and dying. I, James McGill, was born in 2099 on the fringe of the galaxy. When Hegemony Financial denied my loan applications, I was kicked out of the university and I turned to the stars. My first campaign involved the invasion of a mineral-rich planet called Cancri-9, better known as Steel World. The attack didn’t go well, and now Earth has entered a grim struggle for survival.

The Islanders,Christopher Priest,"Reality is illusory and magical in the stunning new literary SF novel from the multiple award-winning author of The Prestige—for fans of Haruki Murakami and David Mitchell A tale of murder, artistic rivalry, and literary trickery; a Chinese puzzle of a novel where nothing is quite what it seems; a narrator whose agenda is artful and subtle; a narrative that pulls you in and plays an elegant game with you. The Dream Archipelago is a vast network of islands. The names of the islands are different depending on who you talk to, their very locations seem to twist and shift. Some islands have been sculpted into vast musical instruments, others are home to lethal creatures, others the playground for high society. Hot winds blow across the archipelago and a war fought between two distant continents is played out across its waters. The Islanders serves both as an untrustworthy but enticing guide to the islands; an intriguing, multi-layered tale of a murder; and the suspect legacy of its appealing but definitely untrustworthy narrator. It shows Christopher Priest at the height of his powers and illustrates his undiminished power to dazzle.", ,9780575070042,Science Fiction|Fantasy|Fiction|Mystery|Speculative Fiction|European Literature|British Literature|Literary Fiction|Literature|Novels|Contemporary

Consider Her Ways,Frederick Philip Grove,"Originally published in 1947, this is Frederick Philip Grove's last and most unique book. In the tradition of Orwell's 'Animal Farm', Grove examines the idea of a utopian society through the story of a group of travelling ants who find themselves in North America. An amateur scientist encounters the colony and makes telepathic contact with a very special elder of the ant community. In fact, the ant infuses the scientist with her memory and uses her new friend as a medium through which she tells the colony's incredible story, a tale that holds up a mirror to our culture, demonstrating to both worlds the parallels and contrasts between the pastoral ways of the ants and the North American life of excess. This classic Canadian novel is back in print for the first time in 20 years, allowing readers to more completely assess Grove's body of works. Fans of speculative fiction will be delighted to see that his prose is as fresh as it was 50 years ago. This was Grove's last novel, and it stands as a testament both to his writing and his prescience.", ,9781895837223,Fiction|Science Fiction

Malevil,Robert Merle,"À la suite d'une explosion, sans doute nucléaire, qui a selon toute vraisemblance ravagé la Terre entière, Emmanuel Comte et ses six compagnons font du château de Malevil, dont la profonde cave leur a permis de survivre, la base de départ de leurs efforts de reconstruction de la civilisation, qui passera également par l'affrontement avec d'autres groupes de survivants, que ce soient des bandes errantes ou des groupes structurés nomades ou sédentaires.La qualification de science-fiction peut être considérée comme exagérée, concernant ce roman, puisque seule la situation de départ (la destruction de la civilisation humaine par une explosion d'origine inconnue) rejoint le thème post-apocalyptique, alors très populaire en science-fiction. Tout le reste du roman raconte comment un groupe de survivants miraculés relève le défi de la reconstruction d'une société humaine. De ce point de vue, on peut dire que le roman relève du genre de la robinsonade.De nombreux thèmes sont abordés dans ce roman : la religion, la politique, la place des femmes dans la société, le monde rural, le rôle du chef, certes sous l'angle d'une mini-communauté mais qui renvoient à notre société.",Folio,9782070374441,Science Fiction|Fiction|Apocalyptic|Post Apocalyptic|Science Fiction|Dystopia|Cultural|France|Science Fiction|Apocalyptic|Novels|European Literature|French Literature|Speculative Fiction|Literature
